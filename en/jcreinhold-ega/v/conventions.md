# Translation conventions — EGA V

These conventions are locked after the §V.1 calibration pass. They **inherit** the EGA IV conventions at
`../iv/conventions.md` verbatim (which in turn inherit EGA II and EGA III); only the EGA-V-specific additions for
*prenote character*, V$\leftrightarrow$IV renumbering, and the differences in source pathology (digital-LaTeX OCR rather
than scan OCR; English-source rather than French-source) are recorded here.

## 1. Inherited from EGA IV

The full EGA IV conventions transfer unchanged: the terminology table, math glyphs and LaTeX policy, block label format
(`<!-- label: V.N.M.K -->`), numbered displays in `$$...$$`, page-break comments (`<!-- original page N -->`),
source-trace footer format, translator-note guidance, modality preservation, cohomology and spectral-sequence rendering,
differential and formal-smoothness notation, regular-immersion and divisor vocabulary, and the citation forms for $(I,
\cdots)$, $(II, \cdots)$, $(III, \cdots)$, $(IV, \cdots)$, $(0_{III}, \cdots)$, $(0_{IV}, \cdots)$, $(M, \cdots)$, $(G,
\cdots)$, $(T, \cdots)$, $(FAC, \cdots)$, `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., …)`, $(Nagata, \cdots)$, $(Zariski-Samuel, \cdots)$.
Re-read those sections in `../iv/conventions.md` before extending the ledger or making a stylistic choice here.

**Block labels.** English: **Proposition (1.1).**, **Definition (1.3).**, **Corollary (1.4).**, **Theorem (5.3.2).**,
**Lemma (5.3.4).**, **Remark (1.2).**, **Scholium (5.8).**. Never French. Each labeled block is followed by a blank
line, the `<!-- label: V.N.M.K -->` comment, another blank line, then the italicized body.

**Proofs.** EGA V inherits EGA IV's inline-prose convention: a proof begins immediately after the labeled italic body,
in ordinary (non-italic) prose, *without* an explicit **Proof.** marker. Long multi-step proofs may use sub-paragraph
markers like "Step 1.", "(a)", or "(i)" inline; do not insert a **Proof.** header retroactively.

## 2. EGA V citation form

EGA V is the never-published fifth volume; we cite it as Chapter V. The §V.N.M.K decimal numbering is used throughout.

- `(V, 5.3.2)` cites EGA V itself.
- `(formerly IV, 20.3.2)` is attached parenthetically **only at the first occurrence in each section** where a §V
  passage was originally drafted under the EGA IV numbering. After the first occurrence in a given file, the
  parenthetical is dropped; subsequent in-section cross-references use V numbering alone.
- `(IV, 17.6.2)`, $(0_{IV}, 19.3.5)$, etc. cite the published EGA IV and earlier volumes as in the EGA IV conventions.
- $(Mumford, \cdots)$ cites D. Mumford, _Lectures on curves on an algebraic surface_ (Princeton, 1966). Used in §V.5 and
  §V.6.
- `(Bourbaki Sém. N)` cites Séminaire Bourbaki exposé number $N$. EGA V references Sém. 232, 236, and 261 in particular.

## 3. V↔IV renumbering map

Grothendieck's prenotes were drafted under the EGA IV numbering and renumbered into EGA V only after EGA IV's Part 1
appeared in 1964. The mapping from prenote section to EGA V section is:

| EGA V (this edition) | Originally drafted as | Topic                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| §V.1                 | EGA IV §16            | Singular and supersingular zeros; differential criteria |
| §§V.2.15, V.2.16     | EGA IV §§17.15, 17.16 | Jacobian and regularity supplements                     |
| §V.5                 | EGA IV §20            | Hyperplane sections and conic projections               |
| §V.6                 | EGA IV §21            | Invertible sheaves; divisors; linear systems            |

The section opening of each translated file states this correspondence inline. Inside-the-section cross-references to
"old §N" are normalized to `(formerly IV, N)` at first occurrence and to plain $(V, M)$ afterwards.

## 4. Prenote character

The Blass & Blass source preserves Grothendieck's *prenote* style: marginal author-to-self comments, occasional
structural sketches, "would be better as Proposition" remarks, and untrimmed French residue (parentheticals tagged
`Fr`). We preserve this character; we do not silently smooth it into clean EGA-style exposition.

### Grothendieck marginal notes

Render Grothendieck's author-to-self comments as italicized translator-marked inserts. For short inline asides ("It
would be a good thing to summarize the above construction into a Proposition 6"):

```markdown
$\ldots$ defined by the vanishing of this section, whose underlying set is the right one.
*Grothendieck note: it would be a good thing to summarize the above construction into a Proposition 6.*
```

For longer asides (a sentence or more set off in the source), use an italicized blockquote:

```markdown
> *Grothendieck note.* In the language of the fathers (which we should give as a remark) a point $\ldots$
```

The marker *Grothendieck note* distinguishes these from the surrounding mathematical prose. Never merge them silently;
that is the prenote character the reader needs.

### `[Tr.]` translator queries

Blass occasionally inserts `[Tr]` or `[Tr.]` queries (typically uncertainties about a French phrase, an ambiguous
notation, or a notational guess). Render these as numbered footnotes at the section foot, with key $[{}^{v}-N-k]$ where
$N$ is the §V section number and $k$ is a per-section running index. The footnote body begins "Translator's note:".

```markdown
$\ldots$ the elongated `G` is the tangent sheaf.[^v-1-1]

[^v-1-1]: Translator's note (Blass): is the elongated `G` the tangent sheaf?
```

When the `[Tr]` query is mathematically substantive (e.g. Blass asks whether a symbol is $G$ or $\mathcal{G}$), retain
it in a footnote even if we settle the question in the body. When the query is purely typographic and has a clear answer
from the PDF, resolve silently.

### `[illegible]` markers

Each `[illegible]` instance: read the source PDF; if the symbol/word is recoverable, drop the marker silently in the
body. If not, render as `[illegible]` inline and add a translator footnote describing the surrounding context. For
example:

```markdown
$\ldots$ homomorphism `M($\varphi$)'` [illegible][^v-1-2] deduced from the section $\ldots$

[^v-1-2]: Translator's note: the prenote source shows an indistinct mark following `M($\varphi$)'`; possibly a prime, possibly
a tilde. The PDF does not resolve it. We follow the Vaiello edition in dropping the mark.
```

### French residue

The Blass translation leaves French interjections at points where the prenotes' bilingual working notes surface:
`en termes de papa Fr`, `sous-entendu Fr`, `pêle mêle Fr`, `confondus Fr`. These are retired into idiomatic English:

- `en termes de papa Fr` $\to$ "in the old language" (translator footnote at first occurrence quoting the original).
- `sous-entendu Fr` $\to$ "tacitly assumed", "understood".
- `pêle mêle Fr` $\to$ "pell-mell", "jumbled together", or restructure the sentence.
- `confondus Fr` $\to$ "coinciding".

When the French carries information the English alone cannot (a Bourbaki-style aside, a deliberate stylistic choice),
preserve the French in a translator footnote with the literal English gloss.

## 5. Math notation locked to EGA IV

All math notation inherits EGA IV. The Blass files render OCR fragments in non-standard forms (e.g. $\Omega 1X/k$, $mX
/m2X$, $d2X/Y \phi$, $PX/Y2$); these are normalized:

| Blass OCR form               | Normalized rendering                           | Notes                                                                                                    |

| $mX /m2X$                    | $\mathfrak{m}_{X} / \mathfrak{m}^{2}_{X}$      | Fraktur for local maximal ideals; superscripts via `^`.                                                  |
| $m2X /m3X$                   | $\mathfrak{m}^{2}_{X} / \mathfrak{m}^{3}_{X}$  |                                                                                                          |
| $Sym(mX /m2X)$               | $Sym(\mathfrak{m}_{X} / \mathfrak{m}^{2}_{X})$ |                                                                                                          |
| $Sym2 (\Omega 1X/Y)$         | $Sym^{2}(\Omega^{1}_{X/Y})$                    |                                                                                                          |
| `OX`, `OY`                   | $\mathcal{O}_{X}$, $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$           | Script $\mathcal{O}$.                                                                                    |
| $d2X/Y \phi$                 | $d^{2}_{X/Y} \phi$                             |                                                                                                          |
| $PX/Y2$                      | $\mathcal{P}^{2}_{X/Y}$                        | Script $\mathcal{P}$ for principal parts (cf. EGA IV §0_IV.20).                                          |
| $d0\phi$, $d1\phi$, $d2\phi$ | $d^{0}\phi$, $d^{1}\phi$, $d^{2}\phi$          | Superscripts via `^`.                                                                                    |
| $V (\phi)sing$               | $V(\phi)_{sing}$                               |                                                                                                          |
| $V (\phi)\sup sing$          | $V(\phi)_{\sup sing}$                          | Or $V(\phi)_{supsing}$ for compactness; both acceptable.                                                 |
| $\Lambda 1$, $\Lambda$       | $\Lambda^{1}$, $\Lambda$                       | Superscripts via `^`.                                                                                    |
| `det`, `Sym`                 | `det`, `Sym`                                   | Unaltered.                                                                                               |
| $\simeq (\approx)$           | $\cong$                                        | Blass uses both $\simeq$ and $\approx$ inconsistently; standardize to $\cong$ for isomorphism.           |
| $\to$, $\mapsto$             | $\to$, $\mapsto$                               | Unaltered.                                                                                               |

| `e.g.`                       | "for example", "e.g."                          | Modernize when verbose.                                                                                  |
| `(K)`, `(Tr)`                | Strip from prose; footnote if `Tr`.            | The `(K)`-style "key" markings in the Blass margins are editorial; they are not part of the mathematics. |

For the OCR's $\Lambda r R$ and similar Greek-Roman ambiguities, consult the PDF; in our experience the PDF resolves
them as $\Lambda^{r} M$ (capital lambda with rank $r$ of the module $M$).

## 6. Source-trace footer

Each translated section ends with:

```html

```

The reconciliation line is included whenever the Vaiello unified file was consulted to resolve `[illegible]` markers or
ambiguities. The PDF entry is narrowed to the relevant fragment (e.g. `EGA-V-1-2.pdf` for §§V.1 and V.2.15-16,
`EGA-V-5.pdf` for §V.5, `EGA-V-6.pdf` for §V.6).

## 7. Prescheme / scheme reconciliation

Inherit the EGA II-IV convention: `préschéma` $\to$ "prescheme", `schéma` $\to$ "scheme". The Blass translation is
inconsistent ("prescheme" in some passages, "scheme" in others). We normalize: when the prenote semantically uses the
1961-1967 sense (separated/quasi-compact-versus-not distinction not yet collapsed), render "prescheme"; when the prenote
uses "scheme" in a sense that survives into post-1970s terminology, render "scheme". The default for these prenotes —
which were drafted in the 1962-1966 window — is "prescheme".

## 8. EGA-V-specific terminology

The Blass translation introduces no new French$\leftrightarrow$English terminology; the source is already English. The
translation ledger at [translation-ledger.md](translation-ledger.md) records the Blass$\to$idiomatic-English term map
(mostly disambiguations and modernizations), and a few additional terms specific to the §V.5 hyperplane-sections theory
and the §V.6 invertible-sheaves theory.

## 9. Six-file layout

EGA V is presented as a single tree with five numbered section files plus six metadata files:

- `00-front-matter.md` — title page, publication-history note, V$\leftrightarrow$IV mapping, sommaire.
- `01-ch5-01-singular-supersingular-sets.md`, `02-ch5-02-jacobian-supplements.md`,
  `03-ch5-05-hyperplane-sections-part-1.md`, `04-ch5-05-hyperplane-sections-part-2.md`,
  `05-ch5-06-invertible-sheaves-and-divisors.md` — five numbered section files.
- One alphabetized terminology index, one source-ordered notation index, one bibliography.

Each translated file's `<!-- source: ... -->` footer points back to the Blass piecemeal source.
