## 8.1. Representable functors

**8.1.1.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.1 -->

We denote by `Set` the category of sets. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category; for two objects $X$, $Y$ of $\mathcal{C}$, we
set $h_{X}(Y) = \operatorname{Hom}(Y, X)$; for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we denote by $h_{X}(u)$
the map $v \mapsto v \circ u$ from $\operatorname{Hom}(Y', X)$ into $\operatorname{Hom}(Y, X)$. It is immediate that
with these definitions $h_{X} : \mathcal{C} \to Set$ is a *contravariant functor*, that is, an object of the category,
denoted $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$, of covariant functors from the category $\mathcal{C}^{\circ}$
dual to $\mathcal{C}$ into the category `Set` `(T, 1.7, d)` and `[29]`.

**8.1.2.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.2 -->

Now let $w : X \to X'$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$; for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ and every $v \in
\operatorname{Hom}(Y, X) = h_{X}(Y)$, we have $w \circ v \in \operatorname{Hom}(Y, X') = h_{X'}(Y)$; we denote by
$h_{w}(Y)$ the map $v \mapsto w \circ v$ from $h_{X}(Y)$ into $h_{X'}(Y)$. It is immediate that for every morphism $u :
Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{X}(Y') & \xrightarrow{h_{X}(u)} & h_{X}(Y) \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle h_{w}(Y')} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle h_{w}(Y)} \\
h_{X'}(Y') & \xrightarrow{h_{X'}(u)} & h_{X'}(Y)
\end{array}
$$

is commutative; in other words, $h_{w}$ is a *functorial morphism* $h_{X} \to h_{X'}$ `(T, 1.2)`, or again a morphism in
the category $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$ `(T, 1.7, d)`. The definitions of $h_{X}$ and $h_{w}$
therefore constitute the definition of a *canonical covariant functor*

$$ h : \mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set). \tag{8.1.2.1} $$

**8.1.3.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.3 -->

Let $X$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$, $F$ a contravariant functor from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set` (an object of
$\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$). Let $g : h_{X} \to F$ be a functorial morphism: for every $Y \in
\mathcal{C}$,

<!-- original page 6 -->

$g(Y)$ is a map $h_{X}(Y) \to F(Y)$ such that for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{X}(Y') & \xrightarrow{h_{X}(u)} & h_{X}(Y) \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle g(Y')} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle g(Y)} \\
F(Y') & \xrightarrow{F(u)} & F(Y)
\end{array} \tag{8.1.3.1}
$$

is commutative. In particular, we have a map $g(X) : h_{X}(X) = \operatorname{Hom}(X, X) \to F(X)$, whence an element

$$ \alpha(g) = (g(X))(1_{X}) \in F(X) \tag{8.1.3.2} $$

and consequently a canonical map

$$ \alpha : \operatorname{Hom}(h_{X}, F) \to F(X). \tag{8.1.3.3} $$

Conversely, consider an element $\xi \in F(X)$; for every morphism $v : Y \to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, $F(v)$ is a map $F(X)
\to F(Y)$; consider the map

$$ v \mapsto (F(v))(\xi) \tag{8.1.3.4} $$

from $h_{X}(Y)$ into $F(Y)$; if we denote this map by $(\beta(\xi))(Y)$,

$$ \beta(\xi) : h_{X} \to F \tag{8.1.3.5} $$

is a functorial morphism, for we have, for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, $(F(v \circ u))(\xi) = (F(u)
\circ F(v))(\xi)$, which verifies the commutativity of `(8.1.3.1)` for $g = \beta(\xi)$. We have thus defined a
canonical map

$$ \beta : F(X) \to \operatorname{Hom}(h_{X}, F). \tag{8.1.3.6} $$

**Proposition (8.1.4).**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.4 -->

*The maps $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are mutually inverse bijections.*

**Proof.** Let us compute $\alpha(\beta(\xi))$ for $\xi \in F(X)$; for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, $(\beta(\xi))(Y)$ is
the map $g_{1}(Y) : v \mapsto (F(v))(\xi)$ from $h_{X}(Y)$ into $F(Y)$. We therefore have

$$ \alpha(\beta(\xi)) = (g_{1}(X))(1_{X}) = (F(1_{X}))(\xi) = 1_{F(X)}(\xi) = \xi. $$

Let us now compute $\beta(\alpha(g))$ for $g \in \operatorname{Hom}(h_{X}, F)$; for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$,
$(\beta(\alpha(g)))(Y)$ is the map $v \mapsto (F(v))((g(X))(1_{X}))$; by the commutativity of `(8.1.3.1)`, this map is
none other than $v \mapsto (g(Y))((h_{X}(v))(1_{X})) = (g(Y))(v)$ by the definition of $h_{X}(v)$; in other words, it is
equal to $g(Y)$, which proves the proposition.

**8.1.5.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.5 -->

Recall that a *subcategory* $\mathcal{C}'$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is defined by the condition that its objects be
objects of $\mathcal{C}$, and that if $X'$, $Y'$ are two objects of $\mathcal{C}'$, the set
$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}'}(X', Y')$ of morphisms $X' \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}'$ is a subset of the set
$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X', Y')$ of morphisms $X' \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the canonical map of "composition
of morphisms"

$$ \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}'}(X', Y') \times \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}'}(Y', Z') \to
\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}'}(X', Z') $$

<!-- original page 7 -->

being the restriction of the canonical map

$$ \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X', Y') \times \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(Y', Z') \to
\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X', Z'). $$

We say that $\mathcal{C}'$ is a *full* subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ if $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}'}(X', Y') =
\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X', Y')$ for every pair of objects of $\mathcal{C}'$. The subcategory $\mathcal{C}''$
of $\mathcal{C}$ formed by the objects of $\mathcal{C}$ isomorphic to objects of $\mathcal{C}'$ is then also a full
subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$, *equivalent* `(T, 1.2)` to $\mathcal{C}'$, as one verifies without difficulty.

A covariant functor $F : \mathcal{C}_{1} \to \mathcal{C}_{2}$ is said to be *fully faithful* if, for every pair of
objects $X_{1}$, $Y_{1}$ of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$, the map $u \mapsto F(u)$ from $\operatorname{Hom}(X_{1}, Y_{1})$ into
$\operatorname{Hom}(F(X_{1}), F(Y_{1}))$ is bijective; this entails that the subcategory $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$ of
$\mathcal{C}_{2}$ is full. Moreover, if two objects $X_{1}$, $X'_{1}$ have the same image $X_{2}$, there exists a unique
isomorphism $u : X_{1} \to X'_{1}$ such that $F(u) = 1_{X_{2}}$. For each object $X_{2}$ of $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$, let
$G(X_{2})$ be one of the objects $X_{1}$ of $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ such that $F(X_{1}) = X_{2}$ ($G$ being defined by means
of the axiom of choice); for every morphism $v : X_{2} \to Y_{2}$ in $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$, $G(v)$ will be the unique
morphism $u : G(X_{2}) \to G(Y_{2})$ such that $F(u) = v$; $G$ is then a functor from $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$ into
$\mathcal{C}_{1}$; $F \circ G$ is the identity functor on $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$, and what precedes shows that there
exists an isomorphism of functors $\phi : 1_{\mathcal{C}_{1}} \to G \circ F$ such that $F$, $G$, $\phi$ and the identity
$1_{F(\mathcal{C}_{1})} \to F \circ G$ define an *equivalence* of the category $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ with the full
subcategory $F(\mathcal{C}_{1})$ of $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ `(T, 1.2)`.

**8.1.6.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.6 -->

Apply Proposition `(8.1.4)` to the case where the functor $F$ is $h_{X'}$, $X'$ being an arbitrary object of
$\mathcal{C}$; the map $\beta : \operatorname{Hom}(X, X') \to \operatorname{Hom}(h_{X}, h_{X'})$ is here none other than
the map $w \mapsto h_{w}$ defined in `(8.1.2)`; this map being bijective, we see, with the terminology of `(8.1.5)`,
that:

**Proposition (8.1.7).**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.7 -->

*The canonical functor $h : \mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$ is fully faithful.*

**8.1.8.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.8 -->

Let $F$ be a contravariant functor from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set`; we say that $F$ is *representable* if there exists an
object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $F$ is isomorphic to $h_{X}$; it follows from `(8.1.7)` that the data of an $X \in
\mathcal{C}$ and an isomorphism of functors $g : h_{X} \to F$ determines $X$ up to unique isomorphism. Proposition
`(8.1.7)` also means that $h$ defines an *equivalence* of $\mathcal{C}$ with the full subcategory of
$\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$ formed by the representable contravariant functors. It moreover follows
from `(8.1.4)` that the data of a functorial morphism $g : h_{X} \to F$ is equivalent to that of an element $\xi \in
F(X)$; to say that $g$ is an isomorphism is equivalent, for $\xi$, to the following condition: *for every object $Y$ of
$\mathcal{C}$ the map $v \mapsto (F(v))(\xi)$ from $\operatorname{Hom}(Y, X)$ into $F(Y)$ is bijective*. When $\xi$
satisfies this condition, we shall say that the pair $(X, \xi)$ *represents* the representable functor $F$. By abuse of
language, we shall also say that the object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ represents $F$ if there exists $\xi \in F(X)$ such that
$(X, \xi)$ represents $F$, in other words if $h_{X}$ is isomorphic to $F$.

Let $F$, $F'$ be two representable contravariant functors from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set`, $h_{X} \to F$ and $h_{X'} \to
F'$ two isomorphisms of functors. Then it follows from `(8.1.6)` that there is a canonical one-to-one correspondence
between $\operatorname{Hom}(X, X')$ and the set $\operatorname{Hom}(F, F')$ of functorial morphisms $F \to F'$.

**8.1.9.** *Examples. I: projective limits.*

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.9 -->

The notion of representable contravariant functor covers in particular the "dual" notion of the usual notion of
"solution of a

<!-- original page 8 -->

universal problem". More generally, we shall see that the notion of *projective limit* is a particular case of that of
representable functor. Recall that in a category $\mathcal{C}$, one defines a *projective system* by the data of a
preordered set $I$, a family $(A_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in I}$ of objects of $\mathcal{C}$, and, for every pair of indices
$(\alpha, \beta)$ such that $\alpha \leq \beta$, a morphism $u_{\alpha \beta} : A_{\beta} \to A_{\alpha}$. A *projective
limit* of this system in $\mathcal{C}$ consists of an object $B$ of $\mathcal{C}$ (denoted $\lim A_{\alpha}$), and, for
each $\alpha \in I$, a morphism $u_{\alpha} : B \to A_{\alpha}$, such that: 1Â° $u_{\alpha} = u_{\alpha \beta}
\circ u_{\beta}$ for $\alpha \leq \beta$; 2Â° For every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and every family
$(v_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in I}$ of morphisms $v_{\alpha} : X \to A_{\alpha}$ such that $v_{\alpha} = u_{\alpha \beta}
\circ v_{\beta}$ for $\alpha \leq \beta$, there exists a unique morphism $v : X \to B$ (denoted $\lim v_{\alpha}$) such
that $v_{\alpha} = u_{\alpha} \circ v$ for every $\alpha \in I$ `(T, 1.8)`. This is interpreted as follows: the
$u_{\alpha \beta}$ canonically define maps

$$ \bar{u}_{\alpha\beta} : \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\beta}) \to \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha}) $$

which define a projective system of sets $(\operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha}), \bar{u}_{\alpha \beta})$, and
$(v_{\alpha})$ is by definition an element of the set $\lim \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha})$; it is clear that $X
\mapsto \lim \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha})$ is a contravariant functor from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set`, and the
existence of the projective limit $B$ is equivalent to saying that $(v_{\alpha}) \mapsto \lim v_{\alpha}$ is an
isomorphism of functors in $X$

$$ \lim \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha}) \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Hom}(X, B) \tag{8.1.9.1} $$

in other words that the functor $X \mapsto \lim \operatorname{Hom}(X, A_{\alpha})$ is *representable*.

**8.1.10.** *Examples. II: final object.*

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.10 -->

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, ${a}$ a set reduced to a single element. Consider the contravariant functor $F :
\mathcal{C} \to Set$ which assigns to every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ the set ${a}$, and to every morphism $X \to X'$
in $\mathcal{C}$ the unique map ${a} \to {a}$. To say that this functor is representable means that there exists an
object $e \in \mathcal{C}$ such that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, $\operatorname{Hom}(Y, e) = h_{e}(Y)$ is reduced to
one element; we say that $e$ is a *final object* of $\mathcal{C}$, and it is clear that two final objects of
$\mathcal{C}$ are isomorphic (which allows us to define, in general by means of the axiom of choice, a final object of
$\mathcal{C}$, then denoted $e_{\mathcal{C}}$). For example, in the category `Set`, the final objects are the sets
reduced to one element; in the category of augmented algebras over a field $K$ (where the morphisms are the algebra
homomorphisms compatible with the augmentations), $K$ is a final object; in the category of $S$-preschemes `(I, 2.5.1)`,
$S$ is a final object.

**8.1.11.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.1.11 -->

For two objects $X$, $Y$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$, set $h'_{X}(Y) = \operatorname{Hom}(X, Y)$, and for every morphism
$u : Y \to Y'$, let $h'_{X}(u)$ be the map $v \mapsto u \circ v$ from $\operatorname{Hom}(X, Y)$ into
$\operatorname{Hom}(X, Y')$; $h'_{X}$ is then a *covariant functor* $\mathcal{C} \to Set$, from which one deduces, as in
`(8.1.2)`, the definition of a canonical covariant functor $h' : \mathcal{C}^{\circ} \to \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C},
Set)$; a covariant functor $F$ from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set`, that is, an object of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C},
Set)$, is then said to be *representable* if there exists an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ (necessarily unique up to unique
isomorphism) such that $F$ is isomorphic to $h'_{X}$; we leave to the reader the task of developing the "dual"
considerations of the preceding ones for this notion, which this time covers that of *inductive limit*, and in
particular the usual notion of "solution of a universal problem".

## 8.2. Algebraic structures in categories

**8.2.1.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.1 -->

Given two contravariant functors $F$, $F'$ from $\mathcal{C}$ into `Set`, recall that for every object $Y \in
\mathcal{C}$, we set $(F \times F')(Y) = F(Y) \times F'(Y)$, and for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we
set $(F \times F')(u) = F(u) \times F'(u)$, which is the map $(t, t') \mapsto ((F(u))(t), (F'(u))(t'))$ from $F(Y')
\times F'(Y')$ into $F(Y) \times F'(Y)$; $F \times F' : \mathcal{C} \to Set$ is therefore a contravariant functor (which
is moreover none other than the *product* of the objects $F$, $F'$ in the category
$\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{C}^{\circ}, Set)$). Given an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$, we shall call an *internal
composition law* on $X$ a functorial morphism

$$ \gamma_{X} : h_{X} \times h_{X} \to h_{X}. \tag{8.2.1.1} $$

In other words `(T, 1.2)`, for every object $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ is a map $h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) \to
h_{X}(Y)$ (so by definition an internal composition law on the set $h_{X}(Y)$) subject to the condition that, for every
morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{X}(Y') \times h_{X}(Y') & \xrightarrow{h_{X}(u) \times h_{X}(u)} & h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle \gamma_{X}(Y')} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle \gamma_{X}(Y)} \\
h_{X}(Y') & \xrightarrow{h_{X}(u)} & h_{X}(Y)
\end{array}
$$

is commutative; this means that for the composition laws $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ and $\gamma_{X}(Y')$, $h_{X}(u)$ is a
homomorphism from $h_{X}(Y')$ into $h_{X}(Y)$.

In the same way, given two objects $Z$, $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, one calls an *external composition law* on $X$, *having
$Z$ as domain of operators*, a functorial morphism

$$ \omega_{X,Z} : h_{Z} \times h_{X} \to h_{X}. \tag{8.2.1.2} $$

One sees as above that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, $\omega_{X,Z}(Y)$ is an external composition law on $h_{X}(Y)$,
having $h_{Z}(Y)$ as domain of operators, and such that for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$, $h_{Z}(u)$ and $h_{X}(u)$
form a *di-homomorphism* from $(h_{Z}(Y'), h_{X}(Y'))$ into $(h_{Z}(Y), h_{X}(Y))$.

**8.2.2.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.2 -->

Let $X'$ be a second object of $\mathcal{C}$, and suppose given on $X'$ an internal composition law $\gamma_{X'}$; we
shall say that a morphism $w : X \to X'$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is a *homomorphism* for these composition laws, if for every
$Y \in \mathcal{C}$, $h_{w}(Y) : h_{X}(Y) \to h_{X'}(Y)$ is a homomorphism for the composition laws $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ and
$\gamma_{X'}(Y)$. If $X''$ is a third

<!-- original page 10 -->

object of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with an internal composition law $\gamma_{X''}$ and $w' : X' \to X''$ a morphism in
$\mathcal{C}$ which is a homomorphism for $\gamma_{X'}$ and $\gamma_{X''}$, it is clear that the morphism $w' \circ w :
X \to X''$ is a homomorphism for the composition laws $\gamma_{X}$ and $\gamma_{X''}$. An isomorphism $w : X
\xrightarrow{\sim} X'$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is called an *isomorphism for the composition laws $\gamma_{X}$ and
$\gamma_{X'}$* if $w$ is a homomorphism for these composition laws, and if its inverse morphism $w^{-1}$ is a
homomorphism for the composition laws $\gamma_{X'}$ and $\gamma_{X}$.

One defines in the same way the *di-homomorphisms* for the pairs of objects of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with external
composition laws.

**8.2.3.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.3 -->

When an internal composition law $\gamma_{X}$ on an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is such that $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ is a *group
law* on $h_{X}(Y)$ for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, we say that $X$, equipped with this law, is a *$\mathcal{C}$-group* or
a *$\mathcal{C}$-object in groups*. One defines in the same way *$\mathcal{C}$-rings*, *$\mathcal{C}$-modules*, etc.

**8.2.4.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.4 -->

Suppose that the product $X \times X$ of an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ by itself exists in $\mathcal{C}$; by definition,
we then have $h_{X \times X} = h_{X} \times h_{X}$ up to canonical isomorphism, since this is a particular case of
projective limit `(8.1.9)`; an internal composition law on $X$ may therefore be considered as a functorial morphism
$\gamma_{X} : h_{X \times X} \to h_{X}$, and so canonically determines `(8.1.6)` an element $c_{X} \in
\operatorname{Hom}(X \times X, X)$ such that $h_{c_{X}} = \gamma_{X}$; in this case, the data of an internal composition
law on $X$ is therefore equivalent to that of a morphism $X \times X \to X$; when $\mathcal{C}$ is the category `Set`,
one recovers the classical notion of internal composition law on a set. One has an analogous result for an external
composition law when the product $Z \times X$ exists in $\mathcal{C}$.

**8.2.5.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.5 -->

With the preceding notations, suppose in addition that $X \times X \times X$ exists in $\mathcal{C}$; the
characterization of the product as an object representing a functor `(8.1.9)` entails the existence of canonical
isomorphisms

$$ (X \times X) \times X \xrightarrow{\sim} X \times X \times X \xrightarrow{\sim} X \times (X \times X); $$

if one canonically identifies $X \times X \times X$ with $(X \times X) \times X$, the map $\gamma_{X}(Y) \times
1_{h_{X}(Y)}$ identifies with $h_{c_{X} \times 1_{X}}(Y)$ for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$. It is therefore equivalent to
say that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, the internal law $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ is *associative*, or that the diagram of maps

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) & \xrightarrow{\gamma_{X}(Y) \times 1} & h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle 1 \times \gamma_{X}(Y)} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle \gamma_{X}(Y)} \\
h_{X}(Y) \times h_{X}(Y) & \xrightarrow{\gamma_{X}(Y)} & h_{X}(Y)
\end{array}
$$

<!-- original page 11 -->

is commutative, or that the diagram of morphisms

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
X \times X \times X & \xrightarrow{c_{X} \times 1_{X}} & X \times X \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle 1_{X} \times c_{X}} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle c_{X}} \\
X \times X & \xrightarrow{c_{X}} & X
\end{array}
$$

is commutative.

**8.2.6.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.6 -->

Under the hypotheses of `(8.2.5)`, if one wants to express that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, the internal law
$\gamma_{X}(Y)$ is a *group law*, it is necessary, on the one hand, to express that it is associative, and on the other
that there exists a map $\alpha_{X}(Y) : h_{X}(Y) \to h_{X}(Y)$ having the properties of the *inverse* in a group; since
for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, we have seen that $h_{X}(u)$ must be a group homomorphism $h_{X}(Y')
\to h_{X}(Y)$, one sees first that $\alpha_{X} : h_{X} \to h_{X}$ *must be a functorial morphism*. One can on the other
hand express the characteristic properties of the inverse $s \mapsto s^{-1}$ in a group $G$ without making the neutral
element intervene: it suffices to write that the two composed maps

$$
\begin{aligned}
(s, t) &\mapsto (s, s^{-1}, t) \mapsto (s, s^{-1} t) \mapsto s(s^{-1} t) \\
(s, t) &\mapsto (s, s^{-1}, t) \mapsto (s, t s^{-1}) \mapsto (t s^{-1}) s
\end{aligned}
$$

are equal to the second projection $(s, t) \mapsto t$ from $G \times G$ into $G$. By virtue of `(8.1.3)`, we have
$\alpha_{X} = h_{a_{X}}$, where $a_{X} \in \operatorname{Hom}(X, X)$; the first preceding condition then expresses that
the composed morphism

$$ X \times X \xrightarrow{(1_{X}, a_{X}) \times 1_{X}} X \times X \times X \xrightarrow{1_{X} \times c_{X}} X \times X
\xrightarrow{c_{X}} X $$

is the second projection $X \times X \to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, and the second condition is translated similarly.

**8.2.7.**

<!-- label: 0_III.8.2.7 -->

Suppose now that there exists in $\mathcal{C}$ a final object $e$ `(8.1.10)`. Suppose still that $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ is a
group law on $h_{X}(Y)$ for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$, and denote by $\eta_{X}(Y)$ the neutral element of
$\gamma_{X}(Y)$. Since, for every morphism $u : Y \to Y'$ in $\mathcal{C}$, $h_{X}(u)$ is a group homomorphism, we have
$\eta_{X}(Y) = (h_{X}(u))(\eta_{X}(Y'))$; taking in particular $Y' = e$, in which case $u$ is the unique element
$\epsilon$ of $\operatorname{Hom}(Y, e)$, we see that the element $\eta_{X}(e)$ completely determines $\eta_{X}(Y)$ for
every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$. Set $e_{X} = \eta_{X}(X)$, the neutral element of the group $h_{X}(X) = \operatorname{Hom}(X,
X)$; the commutativity of the diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
h_{X}(e) & \xrightarrow{h_{\epsilon}(X)} & h_{X}(Y) \\
\downarrow{\scriptstyle h_{e_{X}}(e)} & & \downarrow{\scriptstyle h_{e_{X}}(Y)} \\
h_{X}(e) & \xrightarrow{h_{\epsilon}(X)} & h_{X}(Y)
\end{array}
$$

(cf. `8.1.2`) shows that, in the set $h_{X}(Y)$, the map $h_{e_{X}}(Y)$ is none other than

<!-- original page 12 -->

$s \mapsto \eta_{X}(Y)$, transforming every element into the neutral element. One then verifies that the fact that
$\eta_{X}(Y)$ is the neutral element of $\gamma_{X}(Y)$ for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to saying that the
composed morphism

$$ X \xrightarrow{(1_{X}, 1_{X})} X \times X \xrightarrow{1_{X} \times e_{X}} X \times X \xrightarrow{c_{X}} X, $$

and the analogous one where one permutes $1_{X}$ and $e_{X}$, are both equal to $1_{X}$.

**8.2.8.**
