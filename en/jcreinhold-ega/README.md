# EGA — English translation of *Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique*

This repository contains a complete English translation of the **Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique (EGA)** by **Alexander
Grothendieck** and **Jean Dieudonné** (*Publications mathématiques de l'IHÉS*, 1960–1967) — the foundational treatise of
scheme-theoretic algebraic geometry, spanning EGA I–IV plus the unfinished EGA V.

**Read it online:** <https://jcreinhold.github.io/ega/> — browser-readable HTML with LaTeX mathematics (KaTeX), stable
per-section URLs, the original EGA numbering and page markers, per-volume glossaries of historical vs. modern
terminology, and hyperlinked cross-references within EGA and to the companion
[SGA translation](https://jcreinhold.github.io/sga/).

The translation is LLM-generated and idiomatic rather than literal; it preserves Grothendieck's terminology and
numbering exactly (see *Translation principles* below). The rendered text is Markdown with LaTeX math, built with
mdBook.

## Volumes

- [`i/`](i) — Chapter I: The Language of Schemes
- [`ii/`](ii) — Chapter II: Elementary Global Study of Some Classes of Morphisms
- [`iii/`](iii) — Chapter III: Cohomological Study of Coherent Sheaves
- [`iv/`](iv) — Chapter IV: Local Study of Schemes and Morphisms of Schemes
- [`v/`](v) — Chapter V (unpublished; reconstructed material)

Each volume directory has its own `README.md` with status, contents, and translation notes.

## Translation principles

- Preserve EGA's historical terminology (notably `prescheme` / `scheme`); inline the modern gloss on first occurrence
  per section, and keep a per-volume `glossary.md` ledger.
- Preserve EGA's decimal numbering exactly: `(N.M.K)` within a chapter, `(0, N.M.K)` for Chapter 0 references,
  `(I, N.M.K)` for cross-chapter references.
- Mark original page transitions inline as HTML comments (`<!-- original page n -->`).
- Revise prose for English mathematical idiom while preserving Grothendieck's architectural voice.

## Source

The French source text was drawn from the Grothendieck Circle's archive of Grothendieck's published writings:
