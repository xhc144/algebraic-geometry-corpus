# §6. Flat morphisms of locally Noetherian preschemes

Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism. For every $y \in Y$, the fibre $f^{-1}(y) =
X \times_{Y} \operatorname{Spec}(k(y))$ is also a locally Noetherian prescheme: it is enough to check this when $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ are spectra of Noetherian rings, and then $B \otimes_{A} k(y)$
is a ring of fractions of the quotient ring $B/\mathfrak{J}B$, hence Noetherian. We propose first in this section to
relate the properties of $X$, of $Y$ and of the fibres $f^{-1}(y)$ (where $y$ runs through $Y$), under the hypothesis
that the morphism $f$ is flat. The questions treated will reduce to the study of the relations between the Noetherian
local rings $\mathcal{O}_{y}$, $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$, the homomorphism
$\mathcal{O}_{y} \to \mathcal{O}_{x}$ being local and making $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ into a flat $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-module. In
nos. (6.11) to (6.13) (rather separate from the rest of the section, by their "absolute" rather than "relative" nature),
we apply certain of the preceding results to find criteria allowing us to assert that the singular locus (or certain
analogous sets) of certain preschemes are closed sets; these criteria will play an important role in §7.

## 6.1. Flatness and dimension

**Proposition (6.1.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.1.1 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of $A$, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue
field, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism. Suppose that for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ distinct from
$\mathfrak{m}$, and for every minimal element $\mathfrak{q}$ of the set of prime ideals of $B$ containing
$\mathfrak{p}B$, $\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})$ is distinct from $\mathfrak{m}$ (in other words, that no irreducible
component of $\operatorname{Spec}(B/\mathfrak{p}B)$ is contained in the inverse image of the closed point $\mathfrak{m}$
of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ in $\operatorname{Spec}(B)$). Then one has*

$$ \dim(B) = \dim(A) + \dim(B \otimes_{A} k). \tag{6.1.1.1} $$

We argue by induction on $n = \dim(A)$; the assertion is trivial for $n = 0$, since $\mathfrak{m}B$ is then contained in
the nilradical of $B$, because $\mathfrak{m}$ is the nilradical of $A$. We may therefore suppose $n > 0$. Let
$\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq s$) be the minimal prime ideals of $B$, and set $\mathfrak{p}_{i} =
\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}_{i})$; for every $i$, one has $\mathfrak{p}_{i} \neq \mathfrak{m}$, for otherwise (since $n > 0$)
there would exist a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \neq \mathfrak{m}$ contained in $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, and since
$\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ is minimal among prime ideals of $B$ containing $\mathfrak{p}B$, one would reach a contradiction with
the hypothesis. Consequently $\mathfrak{m}$ is distinct from the union of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ and of the minimal
prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}'_{j}$ ($1 \leq j \leq r$) of $A$ (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. II, §1, nÂ° 1, prop. 2), and
there exists $a \in \mathfrak{m}$ belonging to none of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ nor the $\mathfrak{p}'_{j}$. Set
$A' = A/aA$, $B' = B/aB$; one has (0, 16.3.4)

$$ \dim(A') = \dim(A) - 1, \qquad \dim(B') = \dim(B) - 1 $$

by construction of $a$, and on the other hand $B' \otimes_{A'} k = B \otimes_{A} k = B/\mathfrak{m}B$, hence

$$ \dim(B' \otimes_{A'} k) = \dim(B \otimes_{A} k); $$

it therefore suffices to prove (6.1.1.1) for $A'$ and $B'$. But, by virtue of the bijective correspondence between
ideals of $A$ (resp. $B$) containing $a$ and ideals of $A'$ (resp. $B'$), the hypotheses of the statement also hold for
$A'$ and $B'$; one may therefore apply the inductive hypothesis, which completes the proof.

**Corollary (6.1.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.1.2 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $M
\neq 0$ an $A$-module of finite type, $N \neq 0$ a $B$-module of finite type. If $N$ is a flat $A$-module (resp. if $B$
is a flat $A$-module), one has*

$$ \dim_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = \dim_{A}(M) + \dim_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k) \tag{6.1.2.1} $$

*(resp. (6.1.1.1)).*

It suffices to prove the assertion concerning $N$; on the other hand, if $\mathfrak{b}$ is the annihilator of $N$, one
may replace $B$ by $B/\mathfrak{b}$, and hence suppose that $Supp(N) = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$; the hypothesis then
means that the morphism $f : \operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ corresponding to $\phi$ is quasi-flat
(2.3.3); one deduces (2.3.4) that for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \neq \mathfrak{m}$ of $A$,

<!-- original page 136 -->

every irreducible component of $f^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{p}))$ dominates $V(\mathfrak{p})$, and consequently the condition of
(6.1.1) is satisfied, whence the conclusion.

**Corollary (6.1.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.1.3 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of $A$, $k$ its residue field, $\phi : A
\to B$ a local homomorphism. Suppose that $\dim(B \otimes_{A} k) = 0$ (that is to say (0, 16.2.1), that $\mathfrak{m}B$
is an ideal of definition of $B$). Then one has $\dim(B) \leq \dim(A)$. If moreover there exists a $B$-module of finite
type $N$ which is a flat $A$-module and has support equal to $\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ (which holds in particular when
$B$ is a flat $A$-module), one has $\dim(B) = \dim(A)$.*

The first assertion follows from (5.5.1) and the second from (6.1.2).

**Corollary (6.1.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.1.4 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a surjective morphism. For every closed subset $Z$ of
$Y$, one has*

$$ codim(f^{-1}(Z), X) \le codim(Z, Y). \tag{6.1.4.1} $$

*Moreover, if $f$ is quasi-flat (2.3.3), the two sides of (6.1.4.1) are equal.*

Indeed, if $y$ is a maximal point of $Z$ and $x$ a maximal point of the fibre $f^{-1}(y)$, one has
$\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) \leq \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y,y})$ by virtue of (5.5.2); the inequality (6.1.4.1) follows from
(5.1.2.1) and (5.1.3.1) and from the fact that $f$ is surjective. If moreover $f$ is quasi-flat, one knows (2.3.4) that
every irreducible component of $f^{-1}(Z)$ dominates an irreducible component of $Z$; the maximal points of $f^{-1}(Z)$
are therefore the maximal points of the fibres $f^{-1}(y)$, where $y$ runs through the set of maximal points of $Z$
(0_I, 2.1.8), and at each of these maximal points $x$ one has $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes k(x)) = 0$; since moreover
$\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a flat $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-module, one has $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{y})$ by virtue
of (6.1.1), whence the equality in (6.1.4.1), in view of the fact that $f$ is surjective.

Proposition (6.1.1) admits the following partial converse:

**Proposition (6.1.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.1.5 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $M$ a
$B$-module of finite type. Suppose that:*

*1Â° $A$ is a regular ring.*

*2Â° $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $B$-module.*

*3Â° One has $\dim_{B}(M) = \dim(A) + \dim_{B \otimes_{A} k}(M \otimes_{A} k)$.*

*Then $M$ is a flat $A$-module.*

We proceed by induction on $n = \dim(A)$. If $n = 0$, $A$ is a field since it is regular (0, 17.1.4) and the assertion
is trivial. Suppose $n > 0$; let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$, and let $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ be an element
not belonging to $\mathfrak{m}^{2}$; one then knows (0, 17.1.8) that $A' = A/xA$ is regular and $\dim(A') = \dim(A) -
1$. Set

$$ B' = B/xB, \qquad M' = M/xM = M \otimes_{A} A'; $$

one has therefore

$$ B' \otimes_{A'} k = B \otimes_{A} k, \qquad M' \otimes_{A'} k = M \otimes_{A} k $$

and by virtue of (5.5.1.2) one has

$$ \dim_{B'}(M') \le \dim_{B}(M) + \dim_{B' \otimes_{A'} k}(M' \otimes_{A'} k); $$

<!-- original page 137 -->

one therefore concludes from (0, 16.3.4) that one has

$$ \dim_{B}(M) \le \dim_{B'}(M') + 1 \le (\dim(A') + \dim_{B \otimes_{A} k}(M \otimes_{A} k)) + 1 = \dim(A) + \dim_{B
\otimes_{A} k}(M \otimes_{A} k). $$

Since by hypothesis the extreme members of these inequalities are equal, one necessarily has: (i) $\dim_{B'}(M') =
\dim_{B}(M) - 1$, and since $M$ is by hypothesis a Cohen-Macaulay $B$-module, this means that $x$ is $M$-regular (0,
16.1.9 and 16.5.5); (ii) $\dim_{B'}(M') = \dim(A') + \dim_{B' \otimes_{A'} k}(M' \otimes_{A'} k)$; since $M'$ is a
Cohen-Macaulay $B'$-module by virtue of (i) and of (0, 16.1.9 and 16.5.5) and since $A'$ is regular, the inductive
hypothesis proves that $M'$ is a flat $A'$-module; one then deduces from (0_III, 10.2.7) that $M$ is a flat $A$-module,
since $x$ is $M$-regular by (i).

## 6.2. Flatness and projective dimension

**Proposition (6.2.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.2.1 -->

*(i) Let $A$, $B$ be two rings, $\phi : A \to B$ a homomorphism such that $B$ is a flat $A$-module. Then, for every
$A$-module $M$, one has*

$$ \dim. proj_{B}(M \otimes_{A} B) \le \dim. proj_{A}(M). \tag{6.2.1.1} $$

*(ii) Suppose moreover that $A$ is a Noetherian ring, $B$ is a faithfully flat $A$-module and $M$ is an $A$-module of
finite type; then*

$$ \dim. proj_{B}(M \otimes_{A} B) = \dim. proj_{A}(M). \tag{6.2.1.2} $$

(i) One may restrict to the case where $n = \dim. proj_{A}(M)$ is finite; there exists therefore a left resolution

$$ 0 \to P_{n} \to P_{n-1} \to \cdots \to P_{0} \to M \to 0 $$

of $M$ by projective $A$-modules; since $B$ is a flat $A$-module, the sequence

$$ 0 \to P_{n} \otimes_{A} B \to P_{n-1} \otimes_{A} B \to \cdots \to P_{0} \otimes_{A} B \to M \otimes_{A} B \to 0 $$

is exact; moreover the $P_{i} \otimes_{A} B$ are projective $B$-modules; whence the conclusion.

(ii) Suppose $\dim. proj_{B}(M \otimes_{A} B) = m$, and consider an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to R \to P_{m-1} \to P_{m-2} \to \cdots \to P_{0} \to M \to 0 $$

where the $P_{i}$ ($0 \leq i \leq m - 1$) are projective $A$-modules of finite type; since $A$ is Noetherian, $R$ is
also an $A$-module of finite type. Since $B$ is a flat $A$-module, one also has an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to R \otimes_{A} B \to P_{m-1} \otimes_{A} B \to \cdots \to P_{0} \otimes_{A} B \to M \otimes_{A} B \to 0 $$

and the hypothesis on $M \otimes_{A} B$ implies that $R \otimes_{A} B$ is a projective $B$-module (0, 17.2.1). Since $B$
is a faithfully flat $A$-module, one concludes that $R$ is a projective $A$-module (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. I, §3,
nÂ° 6, prop. 12); hence $\dim. proj_{A}(M) \leq m$, which completes the proof.

**Corollary (6.2.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.2.2 -->

*Let $f : X \to Y$ be a flat morphism of preschemes, $\mathcal{E}$ a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module. If $\dim.
proj(\mathcal{E}) \leq n$ (0, 17.2.14), one has $\dim. proj(f*(\mathcal{E})) \leq n$.*

<!-- original page 138 -->

**Proposition (6.2.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.2.3 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $N$ a
$B$-module of finite type. Suppose that $B$ and $N$ are flat $A$-modules. Then one has*

$$ \dim. proj_{B}(N) = \dim. proj_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k). \tag{6.2.3.1} $$

Consider in effect a left resolution of $N$ by free $B$-modules of finite type

$$ \cdots \to L_{i} \to L_{i-1} \to \cdots \to L_{0} \to N \to 0. $$

Since the $L_{i}$ and $N$ are flat $A$-modules ($B$ being a flat $A$-module), it follows from (2.1.10) that the
$Z_{i}(L_{\bullet})$ are flat $A$-modules, that $L_{\bullet} \otimes_{A} k$ is a left resolution of the $(B \otimes_{A}
k)$-module $N \otimes_{A} k$, and that one has $Z_{i}(L_{\bullet} \otimes_{A} k) = Z_{i}(L_{\bullet}) \otimes_{A} k$ for
every $i$. Note that since $B$ is Noetherian, the $Z_{i}(L_{\bullet})$ are $B$-modules of finite type, hence the
$Z_{i}(L_{\bullet} \otimes_{A} k)$ are $(B \otimes_{A} k)$-modules of finite type. Now, to say that a $B$-module (resp.
a $(B \otimes_{A} k)$-module) of finite type is flat amounts to saying that it is free or also projective (0_III,
10.1.3). Since the $Z_{i}(L_{\bullet})$ are flat $A$-modules, it follows on the other hand from (0_III, 10.2.5) (where
one takes $C = B$) that, for $Z_{i}(L_{\bullet})$ to be a flat $B$-module, it is necessary and sufficient that
$Z_{i}(L_{\bullet} \otimes_{A} k) = Z_{i}(L_{\bullet}) \otimes_{A} k$ be a flat $(B \otimes_{A} k)$-module. The smallest
integer $n$ such that $Z_{n-1}(L_{\bullet})$ is a free $B$-module is therefore also the smallest integer such that
$Z_{n-1}(L_{\bullet} \otimes_{A} k)$ is a free $(B \otimes_{A} k)$-module, which proves the proposition (0, 17.2.1).

## 6.3. Flatness and depth

**Proposition (6.3.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.1 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $M$ an
$A$-module of finite type, $N$ a $B$-module of finite type. If $N$ is a flat $A$-module $\neq 0$, one has*

$$ prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = prof_{A}(M) + prof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k). \tag{6.3.1.1} $$

One may restrict to the case where $M \neq 0$, otherwise both sides of (6.3.1.1) are equal to $+\infty$. We proceed by
induction on the integer $n$ equal to the second member of (6.3.1.1) (which is finite by virtue of the hypotheses, of
(0, 16.4.6.2) and of Nakayama's lemma applied to $N$). Suppose first $n = 0$; then, if $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$
denote the maximal ideals of $A$ and $B$ respectively, $\mathfrak{m}$ is a prime ideal associated with $M$ and
$\mathfrak{n}/\mathfrak{m}B$ a prime ideal of $B/\mathfrak{m}B = B \otimes_{A} k$ associated with $N \otimes_{A} k$ (0,
16.4.6, (i)). One then concludes from (3.3.1) that $\mathfrak{n}$ is a prime ideal of $B$ associated with $M \otimes_{A}
N$, hence (0, 16.4.6, (i)) that $prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = 0$. Suppose therefore $n > 0$, and distinguish two cases:

*a)* Suppose $prof_{A}(M) > 0$. Let $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ be an $M$-regular element, and set

$$ A' = A/xA, \qquad B' = B/xB, \qquad M' = M/xM, \qquad N' = N/xN; $$

one has

$$ B' \otimes_{A'} k = B \otimes_{A} k, \qquad N' \otimes_{A'} k = N \otimes_{A} k $$

since $x \in \mathfrak{m}$, and

$$ M' \otimes_{A'} N' = M \otimes_{A} N/x(M \otimes_{A} N); $$

<!-- original page 139 -->

moreover, since $N$ is a flat $A$-module, the hypothesis that $x$ is $M$-regular entails that $x$ is also $(M
\otimes_{A} N)$-regular (0_I, 6.1.1). One has consequently (0, 16.4.6, (ii) and 16.4.8)

$$ prof_{A'}(M') = prof_{A}(M) - 1, \qquad prof_{B'}(M' \otimes_{A'} N') = prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) - 1 $$

and

$$ prof_{B' \otimes_{A'} k}(N' \otimes_{A'} k) = prof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k). $$

The equality (6.3.1.1) is therefore a consequence of the same relation for $A'$, $B'$, $M'$ and $N'$; but since $N$ is a
flat $A$-module, $N' = N \otimes_{A} A'$ is a flat $A'$-module (0_I, 6.2.1); one may consequently apply the inductive
hypothesis, which proves (6.3.1.1) in this case.

*b)* Suppose $prof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k) > 0$. Consider an element $y \in \mathfrak{m}$ which is $(N
\otimes_{A} k)$-regular; it follows from (0_III, 10.2.4) that $y$ is then $N$-regular and that

$$ N' = N/yN $$

is a flat $A$-module, since $N$ is supposed to be a flat $A$-module. Applying (0_I, 6.1.2) to the exact sequence of
$A$-modules

$$ 0 \to N \xrightarrow{y} N \to N' \to 0 $$

one concludes isomorphisms

$$ (M \otimes_{A} N)/y(M \otimes_{A} N) \xrightarrow{\sim} M \otimes_{A} N' \qquad \text{and} \qquad N' \otimes_{A} k
\xrightarrow{\sim} (N \otimes_{A} k)/y(N \otimes_{A} k) $$

and moreover that $y$ is $(M \otimes_{A} N)$-regular. One has consequently

$$ prof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N' \otimes_{A} k) = prof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k) - 1 $$

and

$$ prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N') = prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) - 1; $$

the inductive hypothesis shows that the relation (6.3.1.1) is valid for $A$, $B$, $M$ and $N'$, and from what precedes,
one deduces (6.3.1.1) for $A$, $B$, $M$ and $N$.

**Corollary (6.3.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.2 -->

*Under the hypotheses of (6.3.1), suppose moreover $M \neq 0$ and $N \neq 0$; then one has*

$$ coprof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = coprof_{A}(M) + coprof_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k). \tag{6.3.2.1} $$

This follows at once from (6.3.1.1) and (6.1.2) and from the definition of codepth (0, 16.4.9).

**Corollary (6.3.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.3 -->

*Under the hypotheses of (6.3.1), suppose moreover $M \neq 0$ and $N \neq 0$; for $M \otimes_{A} N$ to be a
Cohen-Macaulay $B$-module, it is necessary and sufficient that $M$ be a Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module and that $N
\otimes_{A} k$ be a Cohen- Macaulay $(B \otimes_{A} k)$-module.*

This follows from corollary (6.3.2) and from the definition of Cohen-Macaulay modules by the fact that their codepth is
zero (0, 16.5.1), taking into account that the condition $N \neq 0$ is equivalent to $N \otimes_{A} k \neq 0$ by virtue
of Nakayama's lemma.

**Corollary (6.3.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.4 -->

*Under the hypotheses of (6.3.1), suppose moreover that $N \otimes_{A} k$ is a $B$-module of finite length; then one
has*

$$ prof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = prof_{A}(M). \tag{6.3.4.1} $$

<!-- original page 140 -->

*If moreover $M \neq 0$ and $N \neq 0$, one has*

$$ coprof_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) = coprof_{A}(M). \tag{6.3.4.2} $$

Indeed, it amounts to the same to say that $N \otimes_{A} k$ is a $B$-module of finite length or a $(B \otimes_{A}
k)$-module of finite length, and one knows (0, 16.2.3) that modules of finite length $\neq 0$ are of dimension $0$ and
of depth $0$.

Corollary (6.3.4) will be applicable in particular when $B \otimes_{A} k$ is a ring of finite length, that is to say
when $\mathfrak{m}B$ is an ideal of definition of the ring $B$.

**Corollary (6.3.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.5 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a flat morphism.*

*(i) If, at a point $x \in X$, one has $coprof(\mathcal{O}_{x}) \leq n$, then, setting $y = f(x)$, one has
$coprof(\mathcal{O}_{y}) \leq n$ and $coprof(\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)) \leq n$; in particular, if
$\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring, so are $\mathcal{O}_{y}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}}
k(y)$.*

*(ii) Suppose conversely that $\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Then, if
$coprof(\mathcal{O}_{y}) \leq n$ (resp. if $\mathcal{O}_{y}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring), one has $coprof(\mathcal{O}_{x})
\leq n$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring).*

It suffices to apply (6.3.2) for $M = A = \mathcal{O}_{y}$ and $N = B = \mathcal{O}_{x}$.

**Corollary (6.3.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.6 -->

*Let $A$ be a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Then $A' = A[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}]$ ($T_{i}$ indeterminates) is a Cohen-Macaulay
ring.*

Indeed, if one sets $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$ and if $f : X \to Y$ is the canonical
morphism, $f$ is flat (since $A'$ is a free $A$-module (2.1.2)) and for every $y \in Y$, $k(y)[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}]$ is
a regular ring (0, 17.3.7), hence *a fortiori* Cohen-Macaulay; it therefore suffices to apply (6.3.5).

**Corollary (6.3.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.7 -->

*Every quotient of a Cohen-Macaulay ring is universally catenary.*

This follows from (6.3.6), from (5.6.1) and from (0, 16.5.12).

**Proposition (6.3.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.3.8 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring; suppose that there exists an $A$-module $M$ of finite type which is a Cohen-
Macaulay $A$-module and whose support is equal to $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. Let $B$ be a quotient ring of $A$, and let
$f : \operatorname{Spec}(\hat{B}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ be the canonical morphism; then, for every $x \in
\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, $f^{-1}(x)$ is a Cohen-Macaulay scheme.*

Since $B$ is an $A$-module of finite type, one has $\hat{B} = B \otimes_{A} \hat{A}$ (0_I, 7.3.3), hence $f$ is the
restriction to $\operatorname{Spec}(\hat{B})$ of the canonical morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(\hat{A}) \to
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, and the fibres of these two morphisms at a point of $\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ are therefore the
same. One is therefore reduced to proving the proposition when $B = A$. So let $\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{j}_{x}$ be a
prime ideal of $A$; since by hypothesis $\mathfrak{p} \in Supp(M)$, one knows (0, 16.5.6 and 16.5.9) that there exists
an $M$-regular sequence $(t_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ of elements of $\mathfrak{p}$ such that $N = M/(\sum^{r}_{i=1} t_{i}
M)$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module, $\mathfrak{p}$ a minimal associated prime ideal of $N$ and $\dim(N) =
\dim(M/\mathfrak{p}M) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p})$. The same reasoning as at the start shows that one may replace $M$ by $N$
and $A$ by $A/(\sum^{r}_{i=1} t_{i} A)$, and consequently suppose that $\mathfrak{p}$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$.

<!-- original page 141 -->

Set for simplicity $A' = \hat{A}$, $M' = \hat{M} = M \otimes_{A} A'$ (0_I, 7.3.3); one knows (0, 16.5.2) that $M'$ is a
Cohen-Macaulay $A'$-module, which entails that for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}'$ of $A'$, $M'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is a
Cohen-Macaulay $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$-module (0, 16.5.10). Taking (I, 3.6.5) into account, one sees that if one sets $A''
= A' \otimes_{A} A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and $M'' = M' \otimes_{A} A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, $M''$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $A''$-module.
For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}''$ of $A''$ over $\mathfrak{p}$, $M''_{\mathfrak{p}''} = M_{\mathfrak{p}}
\otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A''_{\mathfrak{p}''}$ is therefore a Cohen-Macaulay $A''_{\mathfrak{p}''}$-module (0,
16.5.10); on the other hand, $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is by hypothesis a Cohen-Macaulay $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module and
$A''_{\mathfrak{p}''}$ is a flat $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module since $A'$ is a flat $A$-module (0_I, 7.3.3 and 6.3.2). One
concludes from (6.3.3) that, if $k$ is the residue field of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, $k \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}
A''_{\mathfrak{p}''}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. But since $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is of dimension $0$, the prime ideals of
$A''$ correspond bijectively to those of $k \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A''$ (I, 3.5.7), and if $\mathfrak{q}''$ is the
prime ideal of $k \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A''$ corresponding to $\mathfrak{p}''$, the local rings $(k
\otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A'')_{\mathfrak{q}''}$ and $k \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A''_{\mathfrak{p}''}$ are
isomorphic. Consequently (0, 16.5.13), the ring $k \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} A''$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Q.E.D.

## 6.4. Flatness and property $(S_{n})$

**Proposition (6.4.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.4.1 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism, $\mathcal{E}$ a coherent
$\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module, $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module that is $f$-flat.*

*(i) Let $x \in Supp(\mathcal{F})$ be such that $\mathcal{E} \otimes_{Y} \mathcal{F}$ has property $(S_{k})$ at the
point $x$; then $\mathcal{E}$ has property $(S_{k})$ at the point $y = f(x)$.*

*(ii) Suppose that for every $y \in f(Supp(\mathcal{F}))$, $\mathcal{F}_{y} = \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}}
k(y)$ has property $(S_{k})$; then, if for a point $y \in f(Supp(\mathcal{F}))$, $\mathcal{E}$ has property $(S_{k})$ at
the point $y$, $\mathcal{E} \otimes_{Y} \mathcal{F}$ has property $(S_{k})$ at every point of $f^{-1}(y)$.*

(i) One knows (Err_III, 30) that there exists a closed sub-prescheme $X'$ of $X$ with underlying space
$Supp(\mathcal{F})$ and a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$-Module $\mathcal{F}'$ such that $\mathcal{F} =
j_{*}(\mathcal{F}')$, where $j$ is the canonical injection $X' \to X$; one may replace $X$ by $X'$ and $\mathcal{F}$ by
$\mathcal{F}'$, in other words suppose that $Supp(\mathcal{F}) = X$. Let then $y'$ be a generization of $y$ in $Y$; one
knows (2.3.4) that there is a generization $x'$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $y' = f(x')$; one may moreover suppose that $x'$
is a generic point of an irreducible component of $f^{-1}(y')$; one has consequently $\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x'}
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y'}} k(y')) = 0$. By virtue of (6.1.2), one therefore has, setting $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{E}
\otimes_{Y} \mathcal{F}$,

$$ \dim(\mathcal{G}_{x'}) = \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y'}) $$

and by virtue of (6.3.1)

$$ prof(\mathcal{G}_{x'}) = prof(\mathcal{E}_{y'}) $$

taking into account that depth is always at most equal to dimension. By hypothesis, one has

$$ prof(\mathcal{G}_{x'}) \ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{G}_{x'})) $$

hence

$$ prof(\mathcal{E}_{y'}) \ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y'})) $$

which proves the first assertion.

<!-- original page 142 -->

(ii) Since for every generization $x'$ of $x \in f^{-1}(y)$, $y' = f(x')$ is a generization of $y$, one may restrict to
verifying that if $x \in Supp(\mathcal{F})$ and $f(x) = y$, one has $prof(\mathcal{G}_{x}) \ge \inf(k,
\dim(\mathcal{G}_{x}))$; it follows from (6.1.2) and (6.3.1) that one has

$$ \dim(\mathcal{G}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y}) + \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)) $$

$$ prof(\mathcal{G}_{x}) = prof(\mathcal{E}_{y}) + prof(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)). $$

By hypothesis, one has

$$ prof(\mathcal{E}_{y}) \ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y})) $$

$$ prof(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)) \ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}}
k(y))) $$

whence, adding term by term,

$$
\begin{aligned}
prof(\mathcal{G}_{x}) &\ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y})) + \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y))) \ge \\
&\ge \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{E}_{y}) + \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y))) = \inf(k, \dim(\mathcal{G}_{x}))
\end{aligned}
$$

which proves (ii).

**Corollary (6.4.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.4.2 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a flat morphism, $\mathcal{E}$ a coherent
$\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module. Suppose that for every $y \in Y$, the prescheme $f^{-1}(y)$ has property $(S_{k})$. Then, for
$f*(\mathcal{E})$ to satisfy $(S_{k})$ at a point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\mathcal{E}$ have property
$(S_{k})$ at the point $f(x)$.*

**Remark (6.4.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.4.3 -->

Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $M$ a
$B$-module of finite type which is a flat $A$-module, and suppose moreover that the $A$-module $A$ and the $(B
\otimes_{A} k)$-module $M \otimes_{A} k$ have property $(S_{n})$; can one then conclude that the $B$-module $M$ has
property $(S_{n})$? We do not know this, even when $n = 1$, $M = B$ and $B = \hat{A}$; in other words, we do not know
whether in general the completion of a Noetherian local ring satisfying $(S_{n})$ also satisfies $(S_{n})$, even for $n
= 1$. Setting $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ and $\mathcal{F} = \tilde{M}$, it would
suffice, by virtue of (6.4.1, (ii)), to show that for every $y \in Y$, $\mathcal{F}_{y}$ has property $(S_{n})$ (and not
only when $y$ is the closed point of $Y$); it would also suffice to show that the set $U$ of $x \in X$ such that
$\mathcal{F}_{x} \otimes k(f(x))$ satisfies $(S_{n})$ is open in $X$ (since it contains the closed point of $X$ by
hypothesis). We shall show below (12.1.4) that $U$ is open when $B$ is a local ring of an $A$-algebra of finite type and
$M = B$. On the other hand, for $B = \hat{A}$ and $M = B$, we saw in (6.3.8) that the preschemes $f^{-1}(y)$ are
Cohen-Macaulay preschemes (in other words satisfy $(S_{n})$ for every $n$) when one supposes that $A$ is a quotient of a
Cohen-Macaulay local ring. One concludes that when $A$ is a quotient of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring (or more generally
of a local ring satisfying the hypotheses of (6.3.8)), for $A$ to satisfy $(S_{n})$, it is necessary and sufficient that
its completion $\hat{A}$ satisfy $(S_{n})$. It would remain to be seen whether this property persists without
restriction on $A$.

## 6.5. Flatness and property $(R_{n})$

**Proposition (6.5.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.5.1 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $k$ the residue field of $A$, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism for
which $B$ is a flat $A$-module. Then:*

*(i) If $B$ is regular, $A$ is regular.*

*(ii) If $A$ and $B \otimes_{A} k$ are regular, $B$ is regular.*

This proposition is given for the record, having already been proved in (0, 17.3.3).

**Corollary (6.5.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.5.2 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a flat morphism.*

*(i) If $X$ is regular at a point $x$, $Y$ is regular at the point $f(x)$.*

*(ii) If for $y \in f(X)$, $Y$ is regular at the point $y$ and if $f^{-1}(y)$ is a prescheme regular at a point $x$,
then $X$ is regular at the point $x$.*

**Proposition (6.5.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.5.3 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a flat morphism.*

*(i) If $X$ has property $(R_{k})$ at a point $x$ (resp. if $X$ has property $(R_{k})$), $Y$ has property $(R_{k})$ at
the point $f(x)$ (resp. $Y$ has property $(R_{k})$ at every point of $f(X)$).*

*(ii) Suppose that for every $y \in f(X)$, the prescheme $f^{-1}(y)$ has property $(R_{k})$; then, if for a point $y \in
f(X)$, $Y$ has property $(R_{k})$ at the point $y$, $X$ has property $(R_{k})$ at every point of $f^{-1}(y)$.*

(i) Set $y = f(x)$ and let $y'$ be a generization of $y$; as in the proof of (6.4.1), there is a generic point $x'$ of
an irreducible component of $f^{-1}(y')$ which is a generization of $x$; hence one has $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x'}
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y'}} k(y')) = 0$ and by virtue of the hypothesis and of (6.1.2), $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{y'}) =
\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x'})$. The hypothesis entails either that $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) > k$, in which case
$\dim(\mathcal{O}_{y'}) > k$, or that $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a regular ring, and then $\mathcal{O}_{y'}$ is a regular ring
by virtue of (6.5.1).

(ii) Since, for every generization $x'$ of $x \in f^{-1}(y)$, $y' = f(x')$ is a generization of $y$, one may restrict to
verifying that if $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) \leq k$, then $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a regular ring. Now, one has, by virtue of
(6.1.2)

$$ \dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{y}) + \dim(\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)) $$

hence if $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) \leq k$, one has *a fortiori* $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{y}) \leq k$ and $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)) \leq k$, and the hypothesis entails that $\mathcal{O}_{y}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{x}
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$ are regular rings. One then concludes from (6.5.1) that $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a regular
ring.

**Corollary (6.5.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.5.4 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a flat morphism.*

*(i) If $X$ is normal at a point $x$, $Y$ is normal at the point $f(x)$.*

*(ii) If, for every $y \in f(X)$, $f^{-1}(y)$ is a normal prescheme and if $Y$ is normal at a point $y \in f(X)$, then
$X$ is a normal prescheme at every point of $f^{-1}(y)$.*

This follows at once from Serre's normality criterion (5.8.6) and from (6.4.1) applied for $k = 2$ and (6.5.3) applied
for $k = 1$.

<!-- original page 144 -->

**Remarks (6.5.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.5.5 -->

*(i)* Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $\phi : A \to B$ a local homomorphism such that $B$ is a flat
$A$-module. Let $k$ be the residue field of $A$, and suppose that the two rings $A$ and $B \otimes_{A} k$ satisfy
property $(R_{i})$ (5.8.2); then it does *not* necessarily follow that $B$ satisfies $(R_{i})$, even in the particular
case where $i = 0$ or $i = 1$ and where $B$ is the completion $\hat{A}$ of $A$. Nagata has indeed given an example where
$A$ is normal (hence satisfies $(R_{1})$) but where $\hat{A}$ is not even reduced (hence does not satisfy $(R_{0})$)
[30]. One cannot apply proposition (6.5.3) to this case because the fibres $f^{-1}(y)$ do not necessarily satisfy
property $(R_{i})$ at points distinct from the closed point of $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. We shall however show below
(7.8.3, (v)) that such phenomena do not occur for the Noetherian local rings which one most often encounters in
applications.

*(ii)* The property of being integral for a prescheme does not behave at all like the properties we have just examined
in this no. and the preceding ones: it can happen that $f : X \to Y$ is a flat morphism of finite type, that all the
fibres $f^{-1}(y)$ are regular (and even geometrically regular (6.7.6)) and that $Y$ is integral, without $X$ being even
locally integral. For example, let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, and let $A$ be the
integral ring $k[U, V]/(UV - (U + V)^{3})$ (whose spectrum is therefore a "cubic with a double point"); $A$ is not
integrally closed, and if $u$, $v$ are the canonical images of $U$, $V$ in $A$, the integral closure of $A$ is the ring
$C = A[t]$, with $t = (u - v)/(u + v)$, which satisfies the equation $t^{2} = 1 + u + v$, whence one gets $u =
\frac{1}{2}(t^{3} + t^{2} - t)$, $v = \frac{1}{2}(-t^{3} + t^{2} + t)$ and consequently $C = k[t]$, isomorphic to the
ring of polynomials in one indeterminate over $k$. If $\mathfrak{m} = Au + Av$, the maximal ideal of $A$ (corresponding
to the "double point" of the cubic), there are two maximal ideals $\mathfrak{n}_{1}$, $\mathfrak{n}_{2}$ of $C$,
generated respectively by $t - 1$ and $t + 1$. Let then $B$ be the sub-ring of the product $C \times C$ formed of the
pairs of polynomials $(f, g)$ such that $f(1) = g(-1)$ and $f(-1) = g(1)$ ($\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ is the scheme
obtained by "gluing" two copies of $\operatorname{Spec}(C)$, the point $\mathfrak{n}_{1}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{n}_{2}$) of
one of the two copies being "glued" to the point $\mathfrak{n}_{2}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{n}_{1}$) of the other; cf. chap.
V, where this operation will be discussed in general). There are therefore two maximal ideals $\mathfrak{r}_{1}$,
$\mathfrak{r}_{2}$ of $B$ above the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. Moreover, since the process of "gluing"
commutes with localization and completion, one verifies easily that the canonical homomorphisms $\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{m}}
\to \hat{B}_{\mathfrak{r}_{1}}$ and $\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{m}} \to \hat{B}_{\mathfrak{r}_{2}}$ are bijective, and
consequently (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. III, §3, nÂ° 5, prop. 10) $B_{\mathfrak{r}_{1}}$ and
$B_{\mathfrak{r}_{2}}$ are flat $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$-modules, having moreover the same residue field as
$A_{\mathfrak{m}}$. For every other maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, it is immediate that there are two maximal
ideals $\mathfrak{q}_{1}$, $\mathfrak{q}_{2}$ of $B$ above $\mathfrak{p}$, and that the homomorphisms $A_{\mathfrak{p}}
\to B_{\mathfrak{q}_{1}}$ and $A_{\mathfrak{p}} \to B_{\mathfrak{q}_{2}}$ are bijective. One sees thus that the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is flat and finite, and that all its fibres are geometrically
regular (it is even étale, as we shall see later (17.6.3)); however it is immediate that $B$ is not integral.

## 6.6. Transitivity properties

**Proposition (6.6.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.6.1 -->

*For a locally Noetherian prescheme $Z$, denote by $P(Z)$ any one of the following properties:*

*a) $Z$ is a Cohen-Macaulay prescheme.*

*b) $Z$ satisfies $(S_{n})$.*

*c) $Z$ is regular.*

*d) $Z$ satisfies $(R_{n})$.*

*e) $Z$ is normal.*

*f) $Z$ is reduced.*

*Let then $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be three locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ two morphisms.*

*(i) Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are flat and that for every $y \in f(X)$ (resp. every $z \in g(Y)$), the prescheme
$f^{-1}(y)$ (resp. $g^{-1}(z)$) satisfies $P$. Then $h = g \circ f$ is flat and for every $z \in h(X)$, $h^{-1}(z)$
satisfies $P$.*

*(ii) Suppose the following conditions hold: $f$ is faithfully flat, $h = g \circ f$ is flat, for every $y \in Y$ the
prescheme $f^{-1}(y)$ satisfies $P$, and for every $z \in h(X)$ the prescheme $h^{-1}(z)$ satisfies $P$. Then $g$ is
flat, and for every $z \in g(Y)$, $g^{-1}(z)$ satisfies $P$.*

(i) One already knows (2.1.6) that $h$ is flat; on the other hand, for every $z \in Z$, $f_{z} = f \otimes 1_{k(z)} :
h^{-1}(z) \to g^{-1}(z)$ is flat (2.1.4), and for every $y \in g^{-1}(z)$, $f^{-1}_{z}(y)$ is isomorphic to $f^{-1}(y)$
by transitivity of fibres (I, 3.6.4). The conclusion then follows respectively from (6.3.5, (ii)), (6.4.2), (6.5.2,
(ii)), (6.5.3, (ii)), (6.5.4, (ii)) and (3.3.5, (ii)).

(ii) One already knows that $g$ is flat (2.2.13); moreover, for every $z \in Z$, $f_{z}$ is faithfully flat (2.2.13).
The conclusion then follows respectively from (6.3.5, (i)), (6.4.2), (6.5.2, (i)), (6.5.3, (i)), (6.5.4, (ii)) and
(2.1.13).

<!-- label: IV.6.6.2 -->

Suppose $h$ flat, $f$ faithfully flat, and suppose that for every $z \in Z$, $h^{-1}(z)$ is of codepth $\leq n$ (5.7.1);
then it follows from the reasoning of (6.6.1, (ii)) and from (6.3.2) that $g^{-1}(z)$ is of codepth $\leq n$ for every
$z \in g(Y)$ and that for every $y \in Y$, $f^{-1}(y)$ is of codepth $\leq n$.

be the canonical projection. Suppose either that $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$, or that $k'$ is an extension of
finite type of $k$, so that in both cases $X'$ is locally Noetherian. Let $x'$ be a point of $X'$, $x = p(x')$. Then:*

*(i) One has $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = coprof(\mathcal{F}'_{x'})$; in particular, for $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ to be a
Cohen-Macaulay $\mathcal{O}_{x}$-module, it is necessary and sufficient that $\mathcal{F}'_{x'}$ be a Cohen-Macaulay
$\mathcal{O}_{x'}$-module.*

*(ii) For $\mathcal{F}$ to satisfy property $(S_{n})$ at the point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that
$\mathcal{F}'$ satisfy $(S_{n})$ at the point $x'$.*

<!-- original page 146 -->

One knows that $p$ is faithfully flat (2.2.13); the two assertions are therefore respective consequences of (6.3.2) and
(6.4.2), provided one proves that $p^{-1}(x) = \operatorname{Spec}(k(x) \otimes_{k} k')$ is a Cohen-Macaulay prescheme;
since one of the two fields $k(x)$, $k'$ is an extension of finite type of $k$ by hypothesis, one is reduced to proving
the

**Lemma (6.7.1.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.1.1 -->

*Let $K$, $L$ be two extensions of a field $k$, one of which is of finite type (so that the ring $K \otimes_{k} L$ is
Noetherian). Then $K \otimes_{k} L$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring.*

Suppose for example that $L$ is an extension of finite type of $k$, so that $L$ is a finite extension of a pure
extension $k(\mathbf{t})$ of $k$ ($\mathbf{t}$ being a system $(t_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ of indeterminates). If one
sets $A = K \otimes_{k} k(\mathbf{t})$, $B = K \otimes_{k} L$, $B$ is a flat $A$-module (0_I, 6.2.1) and of finite type;
the morphism $h : \operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is hence finite, and since every Artinian prescheme
is Cohen-Macaulay, to prove that $B$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring, it suffices to prove that $A$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring
(6.3.5). Now, if $S$ is the set of elements $\neq 0$ of $k[\mathbf{t}]$, one has $A = S^{-1}A'$, where $A' = K
\otimes_{k} k[\mathbf{t}] = K[\mathbf{t}]$; by virtue of (0, 16.5.13), it suffices to prove that $A'$ is a Cohen-
Macaulay ring; but this follows from the fact that $A'$ is regular (0, 17.3.7).

**Corollary (6.7.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.2 -->

*For $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ to be a Cohen-Macaulay ring (resp. for $X$ to satisfy $(S_{n})$ at the point $x$), it is

point $x'$).*

**Corollary (6.7.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.3 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian $k$-preschemes, at least one of which is locally of finite type over $k$. Let
$\mathcal{F}$ (resp. $\mathcal{G}$) be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module (resp. a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module).
If $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ satisfy property $(S_{n})$, so does $\mathcal{F} \otimes_{k} \mathcal{G}$.*

The hypothesis entails that $X \times_{k} Y$ is locally Noetherian; let $p : X \times_{k} Y \to X$ and $q : X \times_{k}
Y \to Y$ be the canonical projections, which are flat morphisms. Suppose for example that $X$ is locally of finite type
over $k$; one may write $\mathcal{F} \otimes_{k} \mathcal{G} = p*(\mathcal{F}) \otimes_{\mathcal{O}} q*(\mathcal{G})$,
and since $\mathcal{F}$ is flat relative to the structure morphism $X \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$, $p*(\mathcal{F})$ is
$q$-flat (2.1.4). Apply criterion (6.4.1, (ii)) to the morphism $q$; it suffices to see that for every $y \in Y$,
$p*(\mathcal{F}) \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$ has property $(S_{n})$; but $p*(\mathcal{F}) \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}}
k(y) = \mathcal{F} \otimes_{k} k(y)$, and since $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$, the conclusion follows from
(6.7.1, (ii)).

**Proposition (6.7.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.4 -->

*For a locally Noetherian prescheme $Z$, and a point $z \in Z$, let $P(Z, z)$ be one of the following properties:*

*a) $Z$ is regular at the point $z$.*

*b) $Z$ satisfies $(R_{n})$ at the point $z$.*

*c) $Z$ is normal at the point $z$.*

*d) $Z$ is reduced at the point $z$.*

*This being so, under the hypotheses and with the notation of (6.7.1), if $P(X', x')$ is true, so is $P(X, x)$. The
converse is true if $k'$ is a separable extension of $k$.*

The case where $P$ is property *d)* has been listed only for the record, having already been treated (2.1.13 and 4.6.1).
The same reasoning as at the start of (6.7.1) shows that the first assertion follows respectively from (6.5.2, (i)),
(6.5.3, (i)) and (6.5.4, (i)); likewise, the second assertion will follow from (6.5.2, (ii)), (6.5.3, (ii)) and (6.5.4,

**Lemma (6.7.4.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.4.1 -->

*Let $K$, $L$ be two extensions of a field $k$, one of which is of finite type. If $L$ is a separable extension of $k$,
the ring $K \otimes_{k} L$ is regular.*

Let us distinguish two cases:

*A)* $L$ is an extension of finite type of $k$. Then, with the notation of (6.7.1.1), one may suppose that $L$ is a
finite separable extension of $k(\mathbf{t})$. For every $s \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $k(s) \otimes_{k(\mathbf{t})}
L$ is then a direct composite of a finite number of fields, finite separable extensions of $k(s)$, hence a regular ring;
it follows then from (6.5.2, (ii)) that it suffices to prove that the ring $A$ is regular; since $A = S^{-1}A'$, it
suffices to prove that $A'$ is regular (0, 17.3.6); but it was seen that this was indeed so in the proof of (6.7.1.1).

*B)* Let $(L_{\lambda})$ be the filtered family of sub-extensions of $L$ which are of finite type over $k$; by virtue of
*A)*, each of the rings $C_{\lambda} = K \otimes_{k} L_{\lambda}$ is regular; on the other hand, for $L_{\lambda}
\subset L_{\mu}$, $L_{\mu}$ is a flat $L_{\lambda}$-module, hence $C_{\mu}$ is a flat $C_{\lambda}$-module (0_I, 6.2.1).
Since $C = K \otimes_{k} L = \varinjlim(K \otimes_{k} L_{\lambda})$ is Noetherian, one may apply (5.13.7), and $C$ is
therefore regular.

**Remarks (6.7.5).**

*(i)* In the proof of the fact that $P(X, x)$ entails $P(X', x')$, one cannot dispense with the hypothesis that $k'$ is
a separable extension of $k$. This has already been seen (4.6.1) when $P$ is property *d)*; but even when $X$ is
geometrically integral (4.6.2), it can happen that $X$ is regular without $X'$ being normal.

Take for example $X$ to be a normal algebraic curve over $k$ (II, 7.4.2); the local rings of $X$ being integrally closed
and of dimension $1$ are discrete valuation rings, hence regular (II, 7.1.6), and $X$ is therefore a regular $k$-scheme
(and *a fortiori* satisfies $(R_{n})$ for every $n \geq 0$). To say that $X$ is geometrically integral means then that
the field $K$ of rational functions on $X$ is a separable and primary extension of $k$ (4.6.3). Now, take $k$ to be a
non-perfect field of characteristic $p > 2$, and let $a \in k$ be an element not belonging to $k^{p}$. Let $B$ be the
polynomial ring $k[S, T]$ in two indeterminates $S$, $T$; the polynomial $P(S, T) = T^{2} - S^{p} + a$ is irreducible in
$B$, for one verifies at once that $S^{p} - a$ is not a square in the ring $k[S]$; hence $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$,
where $A = B/PB$, is an irreducible affine curve over $k$. To see that the scheme $X$ is regular, it suffices to show
that it is normal (II, 7.4.5); now $A = k[S][t]$, where $t$ is a root of the polynomial $P$ regarded as a polynomial in
$T$ over $k[S]$, so that the field $K = R(X)$ of rational functions on $X$ is the field of fractions $k(S)[T]/(P)$ of
$A$, a quadratic extension of $k(S)$, hence separable over $k(S)$, and *a fortiori* over $k$. Since $2$ is invertible in
$k$, one verifies at once that $A$ is the integral closure of $k[S]$ in $K$, hence is integrally closed, which shows
that $X$ is regular. Moreover, if an element $f + tg$ of $K$ (with $f$, $g$ in $k(S)$) is algebraic over $k$, so are its
norm and its trace over $k(S)$, and since $k(S)$ is a pure extension of $k$, one concludes easily that one must have $f
\in k$ and $g = 0$, in other words $k$ is algebraically closed in $K$, and *a fortiori* $K$ is a primary extension

<!-- original page 148 -->

of $k$ (4.3.1). However, if $k' = k(a^{1/p})$, $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$ is not normal, for in $k'[S]$ one may write
$S^{p} - a = (S - a^{1/p})^{p}$, and $X'$ is therefore isomorphic to $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$, where $A' = k'[S][t']$,
$t'$ being a root of the polynomial $T^{2} - S^{p}$. Now, $A'$ is not integrally closed, for the element $t'' = t'/S$ of
the field of fractions $K' = k'(S)[t']$ of $A'$ satisfies the integral dependence equation $t''^{2} - S^{p-2} = 0$ over
$A'$ and does not belong to $A'$. In the classical theory, this is expressed by saying that the "genus" over $k'$ of the
field $K'$ of rational functions of $X'$ is *strictly less* than that of $K$ over $k$.

*(ii)* As recalled in (i), it follows from (4.6.1) that when $X$ is an algebraic prescheme over $k$ that is not
geometrically reduced, there are finite radicial extensions $k'$ of $k$ such that $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$ is not
reduced. It is interesting to give an example of this fact where $X$ is a *regular* scheme over $k$, such that $k$ is
*algebraically closed* in the field $K$ of rational functions of $X$. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p > 0$, in
which there exist two elements $a$, $b$ forming a $p$-free family over $k^{p}$. Again denoting by $B$ the ring $k[S,
T]$, let us consider this time the polynomial $P(S, T) = T^{p} - aS^{p} - b$; since $aS^{p} + b$ is not a $p$-th power
in $k(S)$, $P$ is irreducible as a polynomial of $k(S)[T]$, and the scheme $X_{0} = \operatorname{Spec}(B/PB)$ is
therefore an integral affine curve over $k$, whose field of rational functions is $K = k(S)[t]$, where $t$ is a root of
$P$; let us show that $k$ is algebraically closed in $K$. Suppose indeed that $K$ contains an element $z$ algebraic over
$k$ and not in $k$; one would then also have $z \notin k(S)$, hence $[k(S)[z] : k(S)] > 1$; since $[K : k(S)] = p$, one
would have $K = k(S)[z]$, and since $K$ is radicial over $k(S)$, one would have $z^{p} \in k(S)$, hence $c = z^{p} \in
k$ since $z$ is algebraic over $k$; but one would have $t^{p} = aS^{p} + b \in k^{p}(S^{p})(c)$ hence $a$ and $b$ would
belong to $k^{p}(c)$, which is absurd. Let then $X$ be the normalization of the curve $X_{0}$ in $K$, which is therefore
a normal (and consequently regular) curve over $k$. If $k' = k(a^{1/p}, b^{1/p})$, it is clear that $aS^{p} + b$ is a
$p$-th power in $k'(S)$, hence $K \otimes_{k} k'$ is not reduced, nor *a fortiori* the scheme $X \otimes_{k} k'$.

**Definition (6.7.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.6 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a locally Noetherian $k$-prescheme. We say that $X$ is **geometrically regular at a point $x$**
(resp. **has the geometric property $(R_{n})$ at a point $x$**, resp. is **geometrically normal at a point $x$**) if,
for every finite extension $k'$ of $k$, $X' = X_{(k')} = X \otimes_{k} k'$ is regular (resp. has property $(R_{n})$,
resp. is normal) at every point $x'$ whose projection in $X$ is $x$. We say that $X$ is **geometrically regular** (resp.
**has the geometric property $(R_{n})$** (or also is **geometrically regular in codimension $\leq n$**), resp. is
**geometrically normal**) if $X$ is geometrically regular (resp. has the geometric property $(R_{n})$, resp. is
geometrically normal) at every point.*

*We say that an algebra $A$ over $k$ is a **geometrically regular ring** (resp. **geometrically normal**, resp.
**geometrically reduced**, resp. **having the geometric property $(R_{n})$**) if $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ has the same
property.*

If $X = \operatorname{Spec}(K)$, where $K$ is an extension of $k$, it amounts to the same to say that $X$ is
geometrically regular, or geometrically normal, or geometrically reduced, or that $K$ is a separable extension of $k$:
this follows from (4.6.1) and from the fact that if $K$ is a separable extension of $k$ and $k'$ a finite extension of
$k$, $K \otimes_{k} k'$ is a direct composite of a finite number of fields (Bourbaki, *Alg.*, chap. VIII, §7, nÂ° 3,
cor. 1 of th. 1).

<!-- original page 149 -->

**Proposition (6.7.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.7 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a locally Noetherian $k$-prescheme, $x$ a point of $X$; denote by $Q(k')$ the relation "$k'$ is
an extension of $k$, and $P(X_{(k')}, x')$ is true for every point $x'$ of $X_{(k')}$ whose projection in $X$ is $x$",
where $P(Z, z)$ is one of the properties a), b), c) of the statement (6.7.4). Then the following properties are
equivalent:*

*a) $Q(k')$ is true for every finite extension $k'$ of $k$.*

*b) $Q(k')$ is true for every finite radicial extension $k'$ of $k$.*

*c) $Q(k')$ is true for every extension of finite type $k'$ of $k$.*

*Suppose moreover that $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$; then the three preceding properties are also equivalent
to the following:*

*d) $Q(k')$ is true for every extension $k'$ of $k$.*

*e) $Q(k')$ is true for a perfect extension $k'$ of $k$.*

*f) $Q(k')$ is true for every extension $k' = k^{p^{-s}}$, where $p$ is the characteristic exponent of $k$, and $s >
0$.*

To prove the equivalence of a), b) and c), it suffices evidently to establish that b) entails c). So let $K$ be an
extension of finite type of $k$, which is therefore the field of fractions of a $k$-algebra of finite type $A$; set $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. One knows (4.6.6) that there exists a finite radicial extension $k'$ of $k$ such that $Y' = (Y
\otimes_{k} k')_{red}$ is separable over $k'$; if $\eta'$ is the generic point of $Y'$, $K' = k(\eta')$ is a separable
extension of $k'$ by (4.6.1). This being so, $P(X_{(k')}, x')$ is true by hypothesis for every point $x'$ of $X_{(k')}$
above $x$, hence it follows from (6.7.4) that $P(X_{(K')}, x'')$ is true for every point $x''$ of $X_{(K')}$ above $x$,
since $X_{(K')} = (X_{(k')})_{(K')}$, since $x''$ is above a point $x'$ of $X_{(k')}$, itself above $x$, and since $K'$
is separable over $k'$. But one also has $X_{(K')} = (X_{(K)})_{(K')}$ and for every $x_{0} \in X_{(K)}$ above $x$,
there exists $x'' \in X_{(K')}$ above $x_{0}$; it follows then from (6.7.4) that $P(X_{(K)}, x_{0})$ is true.

Suppose now $X$ locally of finite type over $k$, so that for every extension $K$ of $k$, $X_{(K)}$ is locally
Noetherian. Since a radicial extension of $k$ is isomorphic to a sub-extension of an arbitrary perfect extension of $k$,
it follows at once from (6.7.4) that e) implies f); likewise, every finite radicial extension of $k$ is contained in an
extension $k^{p^{-s}} \subset k^{p^{-\infty}}$, hence f) entails b); d) trivially entails e), and finally e) entails d).
Indeed, if $K$ is any extension of $k$, there exists an extension $K'$ of $k$ containing (up to $k$-isomorphism) $k'$
and $K$; since $K'$ is a separable extension of $k'$, one deduces from (6.7.4) that $Q(k')$ is true, then that $Q(K)$ is
true, reasoning as in the first part of the proof. It therefore suffices to prove that b) entails e). We shall take $k'
= k^{p^{-\infty}}$ in e).

The question being local on $X$, one may moreover restrict to the case where $X$ is affine and of finite type over $k$,
replacing $X$ by a neighbourhood of $x$; so let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$, where $B$ is a $k$-algebra of finite type;
moreover, by definition of property $P$ in the cases considered, one may also replace $X$ by the local scheme of $X$ at
the point $x$, hence suppose that $B$ is a Noetherian local ring. Set $B' = B \otimes_{k} k'$; $k'$ is the inductive
limit of its finite sub-extensions $k'_{\lambda}$, and if one sets $B'_{\lambda} = B \otimes_{k} k'_{\lambda}$, the
morphism $f_{\lambda} : \operatorname{Spec}(B') \to \operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\lambda})$ is a homeomorphism of
$\operatorname{Spec}(B')$ onto $\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\lambda})$ for every $\lambda$;

<!-- original page 150 -->

indeed $f_{\lambda}$ is bijective by virtue of (I, 3.5.2, 3.5.7 and 3.5.8); on the other hand, it is closed by (II,
6.1.10). One may now apply (5.13.6), which proves (by virtue of hypothesis b)) that b) entails e) when $P(Z, z)$ is
property $(R_{n})$ at the point $z$. The case where $P(Z, z)$ is the property of being regular (i.e. of having property
$(R_{n})$ for every $n$) follows trivially. Finally, taking into account Serre's normality criterion (5.8.6), b) entails
again e) when $P(Z, z)$ is the property of being normal at the point $z$, for this amounts to saying that $Z$ has at the
point $z$ properties $(S_{2})$ and $(R_{1})$: one applies then what precedes for $n = 1$, and (6.7.2, (ii)) for $n = 2$.

**Corollary (6.7.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.7.8 -->

*Let $k$ be a field; for a locally Noetherian $k$-prescheme $X$ and a point $x \in X$, denote by $P(X, x)$ one of the
following properties:*

*(i) $coprof(\mathcal{O}_{x}) \leq n$.*

*(ii) $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring.*

*(iii) $X$ satisfies property $(S_{n})$ at the point $x$.*

*(iv) $X$ is geometrically regular at the point $x$.*

*(v) $X$ has the geometric property $(R_{n})$ at the point $x$.*

*(vi) $X$ is geometrically normal at the point $x$.*

*(vii) $X$ is geometrically reduced (i.e. separable) at the point $x$.*

*Let $k'$ be an extension of $k$; suppose either that $k'$ is of finite type, or that $X$ is locally of finite type over
$k$, so that $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$ is locally Noetherian. Let $x'$ be a point of $X'$ whose projection in $X$ is $x$.
Then, for $P(X, x)$ to be true, it is necessary and sufficient that $P(X', x')$ be so.*

This has already been seen for property (vii) (4.6.11), and for properties (i), (ii) and (iii) (6.7.1). For (iv), (v)
and (vi), it follows from (6.7.7): indeed, the fact that the condition is necessary follows from the equivalence of the
criteria a) and c), and from the equivalence of c) and d) when $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$. To see that the
condition is sufficient, let $k''$ be a finite radicial extension of $k$; one may always regard $k'$ and $k''$ as
sub-extensions of an extension $K$ of $k$; set $X'' = X \otimes_{k} k''$, $X_{0} = X \otimes_{k} K$, and note that since
$k''$ is a radicial extension of $k$, there is only *one* point $x''$ of $X''$ above $x$ (I, 3.5.7 and 3.5.8). Let then
$x_{0}$ be any point of $X_{0}$ above $x'$; if $P(X', x')$ is true, so is $P(X_{0}, x_{0})$ by virtue of (6.7.7, c) and
d)) (for if $k'$ is an extension of $k$ of finite type, one may suppose that $K$ is too, and if $X$ is locally of finite
type over $k$, $X'$ is locally of finite type over $k'$). One then deduces from (6.7.4) that property $Q(k'')$ is true
(with the notation of (6.7.7)), hence $P(X, x)$ is true by (6.7.7, b)).

## 6.8. Regular, normal, reduced, smooth morphisms

**Definition (6.8.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.1 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism such that the fibre $f^{-1}(y)$ is a locally Noetherian
prescheme for every $y \in Y$, $x$ a point of $X$. We say respectively that $f$ is a morphism:*

*(i) **of codepth $\leq n$ at the point $x$**;*

*(ii) **Cohen-Macaulay at the point $x$**;*

<!-- original page 151 -->

*(iii) **$(S_{n})$ at the point $x$**;*

*(iv) **regular at the point $x$**;*

*(v) **$(R_{n})$ at the point $x$**;*

*(vi) **normal at the point $x$**;*

*(vii) **reduced at the point $x$**;*

*if $f$ is flat at the point $x$, and if in addition the corresponding property $P(f^{-1}(f(x)), x)$ (notation of
(6.7.8)) is true.*

*We say that $f$ is **smooth at the point $x$** if it is locally of finite presentation in a neighbourhood of $x$ in
$X$, and if it is regular at the point $x$. We say respectively that $f$ is a morphism: **of codepth $\leq n$, Cohen-
Macaulay, $(S_{n})$, regular, $(R_{n})$, normal, reduced, smooth**, if it has the corresponding property at every point
of $X$.*

**Proposition (6.8.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.2 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism, $x$ a point of $X$. Designate by $M(f, x)$
one of the properties (i) to (vii) of definition (6.8.1), or the property for $f$ of being smooth at the point $x$. Let
$Y'$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $g : Y' \to Y$ a morphism, $X' = X \times_{Y} Y'$, $f' = f_{(Y')} : X' \to Y'$.
One supposes that $f$ or $g$ is locally of finite type. Then, for every $x' \in X'$ above $x$, the property $M(f, x)$
entails $M(f', x')$.*

Set $y = f(x)$, $y' = f'(x')$; by transitivity of fibres (I, 3.6.4), one has $f'^{-1}(y') = f^{-1}(y) \otimes_{k(y)}
k(y')$; since either $f^{-1}(y)$ is locally of finite type over $k(y)$, or $k(y')$ is of finite type over $k(y)$ (I,
6.4.11), it follows from (6.7.8) that the properties $P(f^{-1}(y), x)$ and $P(f'^{-1}(y'), x')$ are equivalent;
moreover, if $f$ is flat at the point $x$, $f'$ is flat at the point $x'$ (2.1.4), which proves the proposition, in view
of (1.4.3, (iii)).

**Proposition (6.8.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.3 -->

*For a morphism $f$ of locally Noetherian preschemes, let $M(f)$ denote one of the following properties: being Cohen-
Macaulay, $(S_{n})$, regular, $(R_{n})$, normal, reduced.*

*(i) Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be three locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ two morphisms. If $M(f)$ and
$M(g)$ are true, $M(g \circ f)$ is true.*

*(ii) Conversely, if $f$ is surjective and if $M(f)$ and $M(g \circ f)$ are true, then $M(g)$ is true.*

*(iii) Let $X$, $Y$, $Y'$ be three locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$, $h : Y' \to Y$ two morphisms; set $X' =
X \times_{Y} Y'$, $f' = f_{(Y')} : X' \to Y'$. Suppose that $f$ or $h$ is locally of finite type. Then, if $M(f)$ is
true, so is $M(f')$; the converse is true when $h$ is faithfully flat.*

*The conclusions of (i) and (iii) remain true when $M$ is the property of being smooth and (in (iii)) $h$ is
quasi-compact.*

(i) One already knows that if $f$ and $g$ are flat, so is $u = g \circ f$, and that if $f$ and $g \circ f$ are flat and
$f$ surjective, $g$ is flat (2.1.6 and 2.2.13). On the other hand, for every $z \in Z$, the morphism $f_{z} = f \otimes
1_{k(z)} : u^{-1}(z) \to g^{-1}(z)$ is flat (resp. faithfully flat if $f$ is) and for every $y \in g^{-1}(z)$,
$f^{-1}_{z}(y)$ is isomorphic to $f^{-1}(y)$ (I, 3.6.4). If $M(f)$ and $M(g)$ are true, $M(g \circ f)$ is therefore true
for the cases where $M$ is the property of being Cohen-Macaulay or $(S_{n})$, by virtue of (6.6.1). On the other hand
let $k'$ be a finite extension of $k(z)$; set $Y'_{z} = g^{-1}(z) \otimes_{k(z)} k'$, $X'_{z} = u^{-1}(z) \otimes_{k(z)}
k'$, and $f'_{z} = f_{z} \otimes 1_{k'} : X'_{z} \to Y'_{z}$; the morphism $f'_{z}$

<!-- original page 152 -->

is flat (resp. faithfully flat) and for every $y' \in Y'_{z}$, the fibre $f'^{-1}_{z}(y')$ is isomorphic to $f^{-1}(y)
\otimes_{k(y)} k(y')$, designating by $y$ the image of $y'$ in $g^{-1}(z)$ (I, 3.6.4). When $M$ is the property of being
regular, $(R_{n})$, normal or reduced, the hypothesis that $M(f)$ and $M(g)$ are true entails that $Y'_{z}$ and each of
the fibres $f'^{-1}_{z}(y')$ have for $y' \in Y'_{z}$ the corresponding property among the properties c), d), e), f) of
(6.6.1); one deduces from (6.6.1, (i)) that $X'_{z}$ has the same property, hence $M(g \circ f)$ is true.

(ii) Conversely, the hypothesis that $M(g \circ f)$ and $M(f)$ are true and that $f$ is surjective entails that $Y'_{z}$
has the corresponding property by virtue of (6.6.1, (ii)), $f'_{z}$ being surjective for every $z$; hence $M(g)$ is
true.

(iii) The first assertion follows at once from (6.8.2). On the other hand, if $h$ is faithfully flat and $f'$ flat, $f$
is flat (2.4.1); since, with the notation of (6.8.2), the properties $P(f^{-1}(y), x)$ and $P(f'^{-1}(y'), x')$ are
equivalent (6.7.8), one sees that $M(f)$ and $M(f')$ are then equivalent.

Finally, the last assertion of the proposition follows from (1.4.3, (iii)) and from (2.7.1, (iv)).

**Remarks (6.8.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.4 -->

*(i)* If $f$ is faithfully flat, $g$ flat and if $g \circ f$ is of codepth $\leq n$, then $g$ is of codepth $\leq n$, as
follows from (6.6.2).

*(ii)* When, in (6.8.1), one takes for $Y$ the spectrum of a field $k$, the notions (iv), (v) and (vi) reduce to those
defined in (6.7.5). It is clear that the latter are relative to the base field $k$. Definition (6.8.1) then leads to
saying that a prescheme $X$ is "regular (resp. $(R_{n})$, resp. normal) over $k$" instead of saying that it is
"geometrically regular (resp. $(R_{n})$, resp. normal) relative to $k$"; one will take care not to confuse this notion
with the property of being regular (resp. $(R_{n})$, resp. normal) which is independent of $k$. The same remarks apply
here as in (4.5.12).

**Proposition (6.8.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.5 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$, $Y$ two locally Noetherian $k$-preschemes, one of which is locally of finite type over $k$.
For a $k$-prescheme $Z$, designate by $P(Z)$ one of the properties c) to f) of (6.6.1); the property "geometric $P(Z)$"
is then defined in (6.7.6) (resp. (4.6.1)) when $P(Z)$ is one of the properties c), d), e) (resp. f)) of (6.6.1). Then:*

*(i) If $X$ has property $P$, and $Y$ has the geometric property $P$, $X \times_{k} Y$ has property $P$.*

*(ii) If $X$ and $Y$ have the geometric property $P$, so does $X \times_{k} Y$.*

Let indeed $f : X \times_{k} Y \to X$, $g : X \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$ be the structure morphisms, which are
faithfully flat (2.2.13). The hypothesis that $Y$ has the geometric property $P$ entails by virtue of (6.8.2) that
$M(f)$ is true, $M$ being the property of (6.8.3) which corresponds to $P$; under hypothesis (ii), $M(g)$ is also true,
hence assertion (ii) follows from (6.8.3, (i)). As to assertion (i), it follows directly from (6.6.1, (i)).

**Theorem (6.8.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.6 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism locally of finite type, $x$ a point of $X$,
$y = f(x)$. The following properties are equivalent:*

*a) $f$ is smooth at the point $x$.*

*b) $f$ is regular at the point $x$.*

<!-- original page 153 -->

*c) $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a formally smooth $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-algebra (0, 19.3.1) for the preadic topologies on
$\mathcal{O}_{x}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{y}$.*

*c') $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a formally smooth $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-algebra (0, 19.3.1) for the discrete topologies on
$\mathcal{O}_{x}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{y}$.*

The equivalence of a) and b) follows from definitions (6.8.1) and from the fact that for locally Noetherian preschemes,
morphisms locally of finite type are locally of finite presentation (1.4.2).

In the second place, for $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ to be a formally smooth $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-algebra for the preadic topologies,
it is necessary and sufficient that $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ be a flat $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-module and that $\mathcal{O}_{x}
\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$ be a formally smooth $k(y)$-algebra for its preadic topology (0, 19.7.1); but for
$\mathcal{O}_{x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{y}} k(y)$ to be a formally smooth $k(y)$-algebra for its preadic topology, it is
necessary and sufficient that it be a geometrically regular $k(y)$-algebra (0, 19.6.6); this therefore proves the
equivalence of b) and c). Finally, to prove the equivalence of c) and c'), one may restrict to the case where $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $X = \operatorname{Spec}(C)$ are affine, $A$ being Noetherian and $C$ an $A$-algebra of
finite type, that one may therefore write in the form $A[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}]/\mathfrak{J}$. Since here
$\mathfrak{J}/\mathfrak{J}^{2}$ is a $C$-module of finite presentation, the equivalence of c) and c') follows from (0,
22.6.4) applied to $A$, $B = A[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}]$ and $C = B/\mathfrak{J}$.

**Corollary (6.8.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.7 -->

*Let $X$, $Y$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $f : X \to Y$ a morphism locally of finite type. Then the set of
points $x \in X$ where $f$ is smooth (or regular) is open in $X$.*

It follows indeed from (0, 22.6.5) that the set of $x \in X$ satisfying condition c') of (6.8.6) is open in $X$, and one
concludes by (6.8.6).

**Remark (6.8.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.8.8 -->

In (17.5.1), we shall show that the equivalence of b) and c') in (6.8.6), as well as corollary (6.8.7), remain valid
without Noetherian hypothesis on $X$ and $Y$, provided one restricts to morphisms locally of finite presentation.

## 6.9. The generic flatness theorem

**Theorem (6.9.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.9.1 -->

*Let $Y$ be a locally Noetherian and integral prescheme, $u : X \to Y$ a morphism of finite type, $\mathcal{F}$ a
coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module. There exists then a non-empty open set $U$ of $Y$ such that $\mathcal{F}|u^{-1}(U)$
is flat over $U$.*

One may evidently restrict to the case where $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is affine; then $X$ is a finite union of
affine open sets $X_{i}$ of finite type over $Y$; if, for each $i$, there is a non-empty open set $U_{i}$ in $Y$ such
that $\mathcal{F}|(X_{i} \cap u^{-1}(U_{i}))$ is flat over $U_{i}$, it is clear that taking for $U$ the intersection of
the $U_{i}$ will answer the question; one may therefore suppose that $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$, where $B$ is an
$A$-algebra of finite type. One has then $\mathcal{F} = \tilde{M}$, where $M$ is a $B$-module of finite type; the
theorem will follow from the

**Lemma (6.9.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.9.2 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian integral ring, $B$ an $A$-algebra of finite type, $M$ a $B$-module of finite type. Then there
exists $f \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $M_{f}$ is a free $A_{f}$-module.*

Designate by $K$ the field of fractions of $A$; then $B \otimes_{A} K$ is an algebra of finite type over $K$ and $M
\otimes_{A} K$ a $(B \otimes_{A} K)$-module of finite type. We shall reason by induction

<!-- original page 154 -->

on the dimension $n$ of the support of $M \otimes_{A} K$, which is $-\infty$ or finite and $\geq 0$. Suppose first $n =
-\infty$, that is to say $M \otimes_{A} K = 0$; if $(m_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is a system of generators of the
$B$-module $M$, there exists therefore an $f \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $fm_{i} = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq r$; hence $M_{f} =
0$ and the lemma is true in this case. Suppose now $n \geq 0$. One knows that there exists a composition series $M =
M_{1} \supset M_{2} \supset \cdots \supset M_{q} = 0$ of the $B$-module $M$ such that each of the quotients $N_{i} =
M_{i}/M_{i+1}$ is isomorphic to a $B$-module of the form $B/\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, where $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ is a prime ideal
of $B$ (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. IV, §1, nÂ° 4, th. 1). If the theorem is true for each of the $N_{i}$,
there is for each $i$ an $f_{i} \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $(N_{i})_{f_{i}}$ is free over $A_{f_{i}}$; setting $f = f_{1}
f_{2} \cdots f_{q-1}$, it follows that $(N_{i})_{f}$ is a free $A_{f}$-module for $1 \leq i \leq q - 1$. But
$(N_{i})_{f} = (M_{i})_{f}/(M_{i+1})_{f}$ (0_I, 1.3.2) and since an extension of free modules is free, one then deduces
that $M_{f}$ is a free $A_{f}$-module. Replacing $B$ by $B/\mathfrak{p}$ ($\mathfrak{p}$ prime ideal of $B$), which is
still of finite type over $A$, one sees that one may restrict to the case where $M = B$ and $B$ is integral. One then
knows (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §3, nÂ° 1, cor. 1 of th. 1) that there exists an element $g \neq 0$ in
$A$ and elements $t_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$) of $B$, algebraically independent over $A$ and such that $B_{g}$ is
integral over $A_{g}[t_{1}, \cdots, t_{m}]$. One may replace $A$ by $A_{g}$, $B$ by $B_{g}$, and consequently suppose
that $B$ is integral over $C = A[t_{1}, \cdots, t_{m}]$, hence a $C$-module of finite type and torsion-free. One also
knows (4.1.2) that the dimension of $\operatorname{Spec}(B \otimes_{A} K)$ is equal to $m$, hence one has $m = n$.

This being so, if $h$ is the rank of the torsion-free $C$-module $B$, there exists an exact sequence of $C$-modules

$$ 0 \to C^{h} \to B \to M' \to 0 $$

where $M'$ is a torsion $C$-module of finite type; the support of $M'$ does not therefore contain the generic point of
$\operatorname{Spec}(C)$ (I, 7.4.6) and consequently the support of $M' \otimes_{A} K$ does not contain the generic
point of $\operatorname{Spec}(C \otimes_{A} K)$ (I, 9.1.13.1); one concludes (4.1.2.1) that its dimension is $< n$. By
virtue of the inductive hypothesis, there exists an $f \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $M'_{f}$ is a free $A_{f}$-module;
moreover $C^{h}_{f}$ is a free $A_{f}$-module; so likewise is $B_{f}$, which by virtue of (0_I, 1.3.2) is an extension
of free modules. Q.E.D.

**Corollary (6.9.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.9.3 -->

*Let $S$ be a Noetherian prescheme, $u : X \to S$ a morphism of finite type, $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent
$\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module. There exists then a partition $(S_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ of $S$ into a finite number of
locally closed sets in $S$, such that, if one denotes again by $S_{i}$ the reduced sub-prescheme of $S$ having $S_{i}$
as underlying space, and if one sets $X_{i} = X \times_{S} S_{i}$, the $\mathcal{O}_{X_{i}}$-Module $\mathcal{F}_{i} =
\mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{S}} \mathcal{O}_{S_{i}}$ is flat over $S_{i}$.*

We proceed by Noetherian induction (0_I, 2.2.2) on the set of closed subsets $T$ of $S$ such that the reduced
sub-prescheme of $S$ having $T$ as underlying space satisfies the conclusion of (6.9.3). One may therefore restrict to
proving the corollary for $S$ while supposing it true for every closed reduced sub-prescheme of $S$ having as underlying
space a closed subset $\neq S$. Since the morphism $S_{red} \to S$ is of finite type and surjective, one may replace $S$
by $S_{red}$, hence suppose $S$ reduced and non-empty. Since $S$ is Noetherian, the interior $T$ of an irreducible
component of $S$ is non-empty, and the prescheme induced on $T$ is integral; there is therefore by virtue of (6.9.1) a
non-empty open set $U \subset T$

<!-- original page 155 -->

such that $\mathcal{F}|u^{-1}(U)$ is flat over $U$. If $Y$ is then the reduced sub-prescheme of $S$ having $S - U$ as
underlying space, there is by hypothesis a partition $(Y_{i})$ of $Y$ into locally closed sets in $Y$ (hence in $S$)
such that $\mathcal{F}_{i} = \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{S}} \mathcal{O}_{Y_{i}}$ is flat over $Y_{i}$ for every
$i$; it is clear that the $Y_{i}$ and $U$ form a partition answering the question.

## 6.10. Dimension and depth of a Module normally flat along a closed sub-prescheme

**(6.10.1)** Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $\mathfrak{J}$ a quasi-coherent Ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$, $Y$
the closed sub-prescheme of $X$ defined by $\mathfrak{J}$, $j : Y \to X$ the canonical injection. For every integer $k
\geq 0$, the $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module $\mathfrak{J}^{k} \mathcal{F}/\mathfrak{J}^{k+1} \mathcal{F}$ is annihilated by
$\mathfrak{J}$, hence of the form $j_{*}(\mathcal{G}_{k})$, where $\mathcal{G}_{k} = j*(\mathfrak{J}^{k}
\mathcal{F}/\mathfrak{J}^{k+1} \mathcal{F}) = j*(\mathfrak{J}^{k} \mathcal{F})$ is a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module.
By abuse of language, we shall denote by $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$ the graded $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module
equal to the direct sum

$$ \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{G}_{k} = j*(\bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} \mathfrak{J}^{k}
\mathcal{F}/\mathfrak{J}^{k+1} \mathcal{F}); $$

in particular, one has $gr^{0}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{G}_{0} = \mathcal{F} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}
\mathcal{O}_{Y} = j*(\mathcal{F})$. We shall say (with Hironaka) that $\mathcal{F}$ is **normally flat along $Y$** if
$gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$ is a flat $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module. It amounts to the same ((2.1.12) and
(0_I, 6.1.2)) to say that each of the $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Modules $\mathcal{G}_{k} = j*(\mathfrak{J}^{k} \mathcal{F})$ is
locally free.

**Proposition (6.10.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.10.2 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $Y$ an integral closed sub-prescheme of $X$. For every coherent
$\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module $\mathcal{F}$, there exists an open set $U$ of $X$ such that $Y \cap U \neq \emptyset$ and that
$\mathcal{F}|U$ is normally flat along $Y \cap U$.*

Indeed, let $\mathfrak{J}$ be the coherent Ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ defining $Y$; the $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Algebra
$\mathcal{B} = gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{O}_{X})$ is quasi-coherent and of finite type, since it is generated
by $gr^{1}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{O}_{X})$, the inverse image of $\mathfrak{J}/\mathfrak{J}^{2}$; since
$gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$ is a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{B}$-module generated by
$gr^{1}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$, it is a $\mathcal{B}$-Module of finite type. If one sets $Z =
\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$, the structure morphism $u : Z \to Y$ is then of finite type, and if $\mathcal{H}$ is
the coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Z}$-Module such that $u_{*}(\mathcal{H}) = gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$, it
suffices to apply to $u$ and $\mathcal{H}$ the generic flatness theorem (6.9.1) to prove the proposition.

**Proposition (6.10.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.10.3 -->

*The notation being that of (6.10.1), suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is normally flat along $Y$. Then:*

*(i) $Y \cap Supp(\mathcal{F})$ is at once an open and closed part of $Y$ (in other words, a union of connected
components of $Y$).*

*(ii) If $\mathfrak{J}$ is locally nilpotent, $Supp(\mathcal{F})$ is an open and closed part of $X$, and for every $x
\in Supp(\mathcal{F})$, one has*

$$ (6.10.3.1) \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) $$

$$ (6.10.3.2) prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) $$

$$ (6.10.3.3) coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = coprof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}). $$

(i) With the notation of (6.10.1), one has $Y \cap Supp(\mathcal{F}) = Supp(\mathcal{G}_{0})$ (I, 9.1.13), and since by
hypothesis $\mathcal{G}_{0}$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module of finite type, its support is at once open and
closed in $Y$.

<!-- original page 156 -->

(ii) The hypothesis that $\mathfrak{J}$ is locally nilpotent entails that the underlying spaces of $X$ and of $Y$ are
the same, whence the first two assertions of (ii), taking (5.1.12.1) into account; it remains to prove (6.10.3.2), for
one will deduce at once (6.10.3.3) by difference. Let $(f_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq p}$ be a finite sequence of elements of
the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ whose images in $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x} = \mathcal{O}_{X,x}/\mathfrak{J}_{x}$ form a
maximal $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$-regular sequence; the hypothesis on $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathfrak{J}$ entails that the
$\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$-module $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is free of finite type, hence the sequence
$(f_{i})$ is $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{F}_{x})$-regular; one deduces that this sequence is also
$\mathcal{F}_{x}$-regular (0, 15.1.19). Let on the other hand $n$ be the largest integer such that
$\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x} = \mathfrak{J}^{n}_{x} \mathcal{F}_{x} \neq 0$. The hypothesis also entails that
$gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{F}_{x}/\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x})$ is free of finite type, hence the sequence
$(f_{i})$ is also $(\mathcal{F}_{x}/\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x})$-regular (loc. cit.). Applying lemma (3.4.1.4), one concludes
by induction on $i$ an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to \mathcal{F}_{x}^{(n)}/(\sum_{i=1}^{p} f_{i} \mathcal{F}_{x}^{(n)}) \to \mathcal{F}_{x}/(\sum_{i=1}^{p} f_{i}
\mathcal{F}_{x}). $$

But the hypothesis entails that $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x}$ is a free $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$-module of finite type and $\neq
0$, hence $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x})$ is isomorphic to a module of the form
$(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{O}_{Y,x}))^{m}$ with $m > 0$; since
$prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{O}_{Y,x})) = 0$ (0, 16.4.6) one has also, by the characterization
(0, 16.4.6, (i)) of modules of depth zero, $prof(\mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{F}^{(n)}_{x})) =
0$, then $prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{F}_{x})) = 0$; the $(f_{i})_{x}$ belonging to the maximal
ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$ and forming an $\mathcal{F}_{x}$-regular sequence, this shows that one has
$prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = p$ (0, 16.4.6, (ii)).

**Corollary (6.10.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.10.4 -->

*Let $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ (resp. $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$) be the set of $x \in X$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies
$(S_{n})$ at the point $x$ (resp. such that $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) \leq n$). If $\mathcal{F}$ is normally flat along
$Y$, if $Supp(\mathcal{F}) = X$ and if $\mathfrak{J}$ is locally nilpotent, one has $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F}) =
U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ and $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F}) = U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{O}_{Y})$.*

**Proposition (6.10.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.10.5 -->

*The notation being that of (6.10.1), suppose that $Y$ is connected and non-empty, and that $\mathcal{F}$ is normally
flat along $Y$. For every integer $n \geq 0$, set*

$$ (6.10.5.1) r(n) = rg_{\mathcal{O}_{Y}}(gr^{n}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})) $$

*(the locally free $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$-Module $gr^{n}_{\mathfrak{J}}(\mathcal{F})$ being necessarily of constant rank).
Then:*

*(i) There exists a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{Q}[T]$ such that $P(n) = r(n)$ for every $n$ large enough.*

*(ii) One has $Y \cap Supp(\mathcal{F}) = \emptyset$ (in other words $\mathcal{F}/\mathfrak{J}\mathcal{F} = 0$), or $Y
\cap Supp(\mathcal{F}) = Y$ (in other words $Y \subset Supp(\mathcal{F})$). In the second case, let $d - 1$ be the
degree of $P$; for every maximal point $y$ of $Y$, one has*

$$ (6.10.5.2) \dim(\mathcal{F}_{y}) = d $$

*and in particular*

$$ (6.10.5.3) codim(Y, Supp(\mathcal{F})) = d. $$

*(iii) Suppose $Y \subset Supp(\mathcal{F})$. For every $x \in Y$, one has*

$$ (6.10.5.4) \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) + d. $$

*More precisely, there exist in $\mathfrak{J}_{x}$ elements $f_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq d$) belonging to a system of
parameters for $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ (0, 16.3.6) and such that, in $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$, one has
$V(\mathfrak{J}_{x}) = V(\sum^{d}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{O}_{X,x}) \cap Supp(\mathcal{F})$.*

<!-- original page 157 -->

Since $Y$ is supposed connected, the first assertion of (ii) follows from (6.10.3, (i)). If one has $Y \cap
Supp(\mathcal{F}) = \emptyset$, assertion (i) is trivial with $P = 0$. Suppose that $Supp(\mathcal{F}) \supset Y$, and
let $y$ be a maximal point of $Y$; since one then has $Y_{y} = Supp(\mathcal{O}_{Y,y})$,
$\mathcal{F}_{y}/\mathfrak{J}_{y} \mathcal{F}_{y}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_{y}$-module of finite length (3.1.4); setting
$s(n) = long(gr^{n}_{\mathfrak{J}_{y}}(\mathcal{F}_{y}))$, one knows that there is a polynomial $R \in \mathbb{Q}[T]$
such that $s(n) = R(n)$ for $n$ large enough, namely the polynomial $H(n + 1) - H(n)$, where $H$ is the Hilbert-Samuel
polynomial of $\mathcal{F}_{y}$ for the $\mathfrak{J}_{y}$-preadic filtration (0, 16.2.1). Since the
$\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$-modules $gr^{n}_{\mathfrak{J}_{y}}(\mathcal{F}_{y})$ are free by hypothesis, one has $r(n) =
s(n)/m$, denoting by $m$ the length of the $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$-module $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y} =
\mathcal{O}_{y}/\mathfrak{J}_{y}$; one therefore satisfies (i) by taking $P = (1/m)R$. One knows in addition (0, 16.2.3)
that $deg(H) = \dim(\mathcal{F}_{y})$, whence the relation (6.10.5.2); the relation (6.10.5.3) follows from this by
means of (5.1.12.2).

It remains to prove (iii) for any point $x \in Y$. Set $A = \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$, $\mathfrak{J} = \mathfrak{J}_{x}$, so
that $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x} = A/\mathfrak{J}$, and $M = \mathcal{F}_{x}$; let $S = gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(A)$, which is
a graded $(A/\mathfrak{J})$-algebra of finite type, with positive degrees, such that $S_{0} = A/\mathfrak{J}$, and
generated by its homogeneous elements of degree $1$; let finally $N = gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}}(M)$, which is a graded
$S$-module of finite type, each homogeneous component $N_{n}$ being by hypothesis a free $(A/\mathfrak{J})$-module of
length $r(n)$. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field; $B = S
\otimes_{A} k$ is a graded $k$-algebra of finite type, with positive degrees, generated by its homogeneous elements of
degree $1$ and such that $B_{0} = k$, so that $\mathfrak{q} = B_{+} = \bigoplus_{n \geq 1} B_{n}$ is a maximal ideal in
$B$; $E = N \otimes_{A} k$ is a graded $B$-module of finite type such that $rg_{k}(E_{n}) = r(n)$. Apply (0, 16.2.7) to
the graded ring $B = S \otimes_{A} k$ and to the graded $B$-module $E = N \otimes_{A} k$, and let $\bar{f}_{i} \in
\mathfrak{q}^{n_{i}}$ ($1 \leq i \leq d$) be an element of which $f_{i}$ is the image in $B_{n_{i}}$. For $n \geq
\sup(n_{i})$, consider the sub-$A$-module $\sum^{d}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathfrak{J}^{n-n_{i}} M$ of $M$; since the homogeneous
component of degree $n$ of the sub-module $\sum^{d}_{i=1} \bar{f}_{i} E$ of $E$ is equal to $E_{n}$ once $n$ is large
enough, one sees that, for $n$ large enough, one has

$$ \mathfrak{J}^{n} M = \sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{i} \mathfrak{J}^{n-n_{i}} M + \mathfrak{m} \mathfrak{J}^{n} M $$

and since $\mathfrak{J}^{n} M$ is an $A$-module of finite type, this entails, by Nakayama's lemma,

$$ \mathfrak{J}^{n} M = \sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{i} \mathfrak{J}^{n-n_{i}} M \subset \sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{i} M. $$

If $\mathfrak{a}$ is the annihilator of $M$, one has therefore (0_I, 1.7.5) in $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$

$$ V(\sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{i} A) \cap V(\mathfrak{a}) \subset V(\mathfrak{J}^{n} M) = V(\mathfrak{J}) \cap V(\mathfrak{a}) =
V(\mathfrak{J}) $$

since by hypothesis $Y \cap \operatorname{Spec}(A) = V(\mathfrak{J}) \cap Supp(M) = V(\mathfrak{J})$. Since on the other
hand the $f_{i}$ belong to $\mathfrak{J}$, one has $V(\mathfrak{J}) \subset V(\sum^{d}_{i=1} f_{i} A)$, which proves the
last relation of (iii). It remains to show that the $f_{i}$ belong to a system of parameters for $M$. Replacing $A$ by
$A/\mathfrak{a}$ and the $f_{i}$ by their images in $A/\mathfrak{a}$, one may restrict to the case where $\mathfrak{a} =
0$; one has just seen that one has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{J}) = \dim(A/(\sum^{d}_{i=1} f_{i} A))$ and it therefore remains to
prove (0, 16.3.7) that one has

$$ \dim(A) \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{J}) + d. $$

Now, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{J}$ and such that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{J}) =
\dim(A/\mathfrak{p})$, so that $\mathfrak{p}$ is minimal among the prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{J}$. One has
therefore $\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{j}_{y}$, where $y \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is a maximal point of $Y$. But by
virtue of (6.10.5.2) and of the hypothesis $\operatorname{Spec}(A) = Supp(M)$, one has $\dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) = d$; the
inequality $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) + \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) \le \dim(A)$ (0, 16.1.4) completes the proof.

**Proposition (6.10.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.10.6 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module, $Y$ an irreducible closed
sub-prescheme of $X$, of generic point $y \in Supp(\mathcal{F})$. There exists then a non-empty open neighbourhood $U$
of $y$ in $X$ such that, for every $x \in U \cap Y$, one has*

$$ \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{F}_{y}) + \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) \tag{6.10.6.1} $$

$$ prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = prof(\mathcal{F}_{y}) + prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) \tag{6.10.6.2} $$

$$ coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = coprof(\mathcal{F}_{y}) + coprof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}). \tag{6.10.6.3} $$

<!-- original page 158 -->

Let $Y' = Y_{red}$, which is an integral closed sub-prescheme of $Y$ having the same underlying space, and defined by a
locally nilpotent Ideal $\mathcal{K}$ of $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ (I, 6.1.6). It follows that
$gr^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{K}}(\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ is a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{Y'}$-Module, and since $Y'$ is integral, there
is a neighbourhood $V$ of $y$ in $Y'$ such that $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{K}}(\mathcal{O}_{Y})|V$ is locally free (0_I,
5.2.7); in other words, up to replacing $X$ by a neighbourhood of $y$, one may suppose that $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ is
normally flat along $Y'$; one deduces from (6.10.3) that one has

$$ \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{Y',x}), \qquad prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) = prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y',x}) $$

for every $x \in Y$; this allows us to restrict to the case where the closed sub-prescheme $Y$ is integral.

This being so, by virtue of (6.10.2), one may, replacing $X$ by an open neighbourhood of $y$, suppose that $\mathcal{F}$
is normally flat along $Y$. Since $y \in Supp(\mathcal{F})$, the relation (6.10.6.1) follows from (6.10.5.2) and
(6.10.5.4). Set now $p = prof(\mathcal{F}_{y})$; replacing $X$ if necessary by an open neighbourhood of $y$, one may
suppose that there exist $p$ sections $f_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq p$) of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ above $X$, forming an
$\mathcal{F}$-regular sequence, such that the $(f_{i})_{y}$ belong to the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{y}$ of
$\mathcal{O}_{y}$ and $prof(\mathcal{F}_{y}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} (f_{i})_{y} \mathcal{F}_{y})) = 0$ (0, 16.4.6). If
$\mathfrak{J}$ is the Ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ defining $Y$, one has $\mathfrak{J}_{y} \subset \mathfrak{m}_{y}$, and,
replacing $X$ again if necessary by a neighbourhood of $y$, one may suppose that $f_{i} \in \Gamma(X, \mathfrak{J})$ for
$1 \leq i \leq p$. Moreover, if one sets $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{F}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{F})$, the hypothesis
$prof(\mathcal{F}_{y}) = 0$ entails that $\mathcal{G}_{y}$ contains a sub-module isomorphic to
$\mathcal{O}_{y}/\mathfrak{J}_{y}$ (0, 16.4.6); the same reasoning (taking (0_I, 5.3.8 and 5.2.7) into account) shows
that one may suppose there exists a sub-$\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathcal{G}$ isomorphic to
$\mathcal{O}_{X}/\mathfrak{J}$ such that $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$ for every $x \in Y$. Set $\mathcal{G}' =
\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{S}$; replacing $X$ by an open neighbourhood of $y$, one may, by virtue of (6.10.2), suppose that
$\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ are normally flat along $Y$. Let then $x$ be any point of $Y$, and set $q =
prof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) = prof(\mathcal{S}_{x})$; let $(g_{j})_{1 \leq j \leq q}$ be a maximal $\mathcal{S}_{x}$-regular
sequence of elements of the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{x}$ of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$. Each of the homogeneous components
of $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{G})$ is a flat $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$-module of finite type by hypothesis,
hence is a free $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$-module, and so is likewise $gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{G}')$; since
the sequence $(g_{j})$ is $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$-regular, it is consequently
$gr^{\bullet}_{\mathfrak{J}_{x}}(\mathcal{G}')$-regular, whence one concludes it is $\mathcal{G}'_{x}$-regular (0,
15.1.19). Applying lemma (0, 15.1.18) to the exact sequence

$$ 0 \to \mathcal{S}_{x} \to \mathcal{G}_{x} \to \mathcal{G}'_{x} \to 0 $$

by induction on $j$, one concludes an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to \mathcal{S}_{x}/(\sum_{j=1}^{q} g_{j} \mathcal{S}_{x}) \to \mathcal{G}_{x}/(\sum_{j=1}^{q} g_{j}
\mathcal{G}_{x}). $$

But by hypothesis $prof(\mathcal{S}_{x}/(\sum^{q}_{j=1} g_{j} \mathcal{S}_{x})) = 0$ (0, 16.4.6); by the
characterization (0, 16.4.6) of modules of depth zero, one concludes that $prof(\mathcal{G}_{x}/(\sum^{q}_{j=1} g_{j}
\mathcal{G}_{x})) = 0 = prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}/(\sum^{p}_{i=1} f_{i} \mathcal{F}_{x} + \sum^{q}_{j=1} g_{j}
\mathcal{F}_{x}))$; the sequence $(g_{j})$ being $\mathcal{S}_{x}$-regular and $\mathcal{G}'_{x}$-regular, is also
$\mathcal{G}_{x}$-regular; finally, the sequence $((f_{i})_{x})$ is $\mathcal{F}_{x}$-regular by hypothesis and is
formed of elements of the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{x}$; one deduces (0, 16.4.6) that $prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = p +
q$, which completes the proof.

## 6.11. Criteria for the sets $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ or $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ to be open

**Lemma (6.11.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.1 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module; then the function $x
\mapsto \dim. proj(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is upper semi-continuous on $X$.*

One may restrict to the case where $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is the spectrum of a Noetherian ring and $\mathcal{F} =
\tilde{M}$, where $M$ is an $A$-module of finite type. Suppose that for an $x \in X$, one has $\dim. proj(M_{x}) = n <
+\infty$ (if $n = +\infty$ there is nothing to prove); there exists a resolution of $M$

$$ L_{n-1} \to L_{n-2} \to \cdots \to L_{0} \to M \to 0 $$

<!-- original page 159 -->

where the $L_{i}$ are free $A$-modules of finite type ($A$ being Noetherian), whence an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to R \to L_{n-1} \to L_{n-2} \to \cdots \to L_{0} \to M \to 0 $$

where $R$ is an $A$-module of finite type; one deduces an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to R_{x} \to (L_{n-1})_{x} \to \cdots \to (L_{0})_{x} \to M_{x} \to 0 $$

where the $(L_{i})_{x}$ are free $A_{x}$-modules of finite type; since by hypothesis $\dim. proj(M_{x}) = n$, this
entails that $R_{x}$ is a projective $A_{x}$-module of finite type (M, VI, 2.1) and consequently a free $A_{x}$-module
of finite type (0_III, 10.1.3). One concludes that there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that, for
every $x' \in U$, $R_{x'}$ is a free $A_{x'}$-module (0_I, 5.2.7), hence $M_{x'}$ admits a projective resolution of
length $n$, in other words $\dim. proj(M_{x'}) \leq n$, which proves the lemma.

**Proposition (6.11.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.2 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme locally immersible in a regular scheme (5.11.1); let $\mathcal{F}$ be a
coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module. Then:*

*(i) (M. Auslander) The function $x \mapsto coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is upper semi-continuous on $X$ (in other words,
for every integer $n$, the set $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ of $x \in X$ such that $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) \leq n$ is
open).*

*(ii) For every integer $n$, the set $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ of $x \in X$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ has property
$(S_{n})$ at the point $x$ is open.*

(i) The question being local on $X$, one may, by virtue of the hypothesis, restrict to the case where $X$ is a closed
sub-scheme of a regular affine scheme $Y$. If $j : X \to Y$ is the canonical injection, and $\mathcal{G} =
j_{*}(\mathcal{F})$, one knows that one then has, for every $x \in X$, $\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{G}_{x})$
and $prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = prof(\mathcal{G}_{x})$, hence $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = coprof(\mathcal{G}_{x})$, and
since $coprof(\mathcal{G}_{y}) = 0$ for $y \in Y - X$, one is reduced to proving the property for $\mathcal{G}$; in
other words, one may restrict to the case where $X$ is a regular affine scheme. One then knows (0, 17.3.4) that one has

$$ prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{x}) - \dim. proj(\mathcal{F}_{x}). $$

On the other hand, if $S$ is the unique closed sub-prescheme of $X$ with underlying space $Supp(\mathcal{F})$, one has
$\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = codim({x}, S)$ (5.1.12.1), and, by virtue of (5.1.9)

$$ \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}) - codim_{x}(S, X) $$

since $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is a regular ring, and *a fortiori* biequidimensional (0, 16.5.12). One may therefore write

$$ coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim. proj(\mathcal{F}_{x}) - codim_{x}(S, X) \tag{6.11.2.1} $$

and the proposition then follows from (6.11.1) and from (0, 14.2.6).

(ii) Since the $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ are open for every $n$ by (i), the $Z_{n} = X - U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ are
closed in $X$; moreover it is clear that $Z_{n+1} \subset Z_{n}$, and since $\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is finite for every
$x \in X$ and $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) \leq \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x})$, the intersection of the $Z_{n}$ is empty; since one
may restrict to the case where $X$ is affine, hence quasi-compact, one may suppose that there exists an $m$

<!-- original page 160 -->

such that $Z_{m} = \emptyset$. Now, it follows from (5.7.4) that the relation $x \in U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is
equivalent to the set of relations

$$ codim_{x}(Z_{k}, S) > n + k \tag{6.11.2.2} $$

for every $k \geq 0$; but for $k \geq m$ this relation is automatically satisfied, hence one has in fact only to
consider the relations (6.11.2.2) for $0 \leq k < m$. Now (0, 14.2.6) the set $V_{n,k}$ of $x$ satisfying (6.11.2.2) is
open, and $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$, intersection of the $V_{n,k}$ for $0 \leq k < m$, is also open. Q.E.D.

Recall that the hypothesis that $X$ is locally immersible in a regular scheme is always fulfilled when $X$ is a
prescheme locally of finite type over a field $k$ (5.8.3).

**Corollary (6.11.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.3 -->

*Under the hypotheses of (6.11.2), the set $CM(\mathcal{F})$ of points $x \in X$ such that $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ is a
Cohen-Macaulay module is open in $X$.*

Indeed, it is the set $U_{C_{0}}(\mathcal{F})$.

**Remarks (6.11.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.4 -->

*(i)* The reasoning of (6.11.2, (ii)) proves that (without hypothesis on $X$) when $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is open for
every integer $n$, then $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is open for every integer $n$.

*(ii)* One has $CM(\mathcal{F}) = \bigcap_{n} U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$. If every point $x \in X$ admits an open
neighbourhood $V$ of finite dimension, the sequence of intersections $V \cap U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is stationary since
there exists an $m$ such that $\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) \leq m$ for every $x \in V$; consequently, if the
$U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ are open for every integer $n$, $CM(\mathcal{F})$ is then open in $X$.

*(iii)* One will write $U_{S_{n}}(X)$, $U_{C_{n}}(X)$, $CM(X)$ instead of $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{O}_{X})$,
$U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{O}_{X})$, $CM(\mathcal{O}_{X})$.

**Proposition (6.11.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.5 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, one
has*

$$ (6.11.5.1) coprof_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) \leq coprof_{A}(M). $$

One may restrict to the case $M_{\mathfrak{p}} \neq 0$. Since $\hat{A}$ is a faithfully flat $A$-module (0_I, 7.3.5),
there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $\hat{A}$ above $\mathfrak{p}$ (0_I, 6.5.1); since $\hat{M}_{\mathfrak{p}}
= (M \otimes_{A} \hat{A}) \otimes_{A} A_{\mathfrak{p}} = M \otimes_{A} \hat{A}_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and
$\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is a flat $\hat{A}$-module, hence a flat $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module (0_I, 6.2.1), it follows
from (6.3.2), applied to the local homomorphism $A_{\mathfrak{p}} \to \hat{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}$, to $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and
$\hat{M}_{\mathfrak{q}} = M_{\mathfrak{p}} \otimes_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}} \hat{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}$, that one has
$coprof_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) \leq coprof_{\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}}(\hat{M}_{\mathfrak{q}})$. On the other
hand, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(\hat{A})$ is isomorphic to a sub-scheme of a regular scheme by virtue of Cohen's theorem
(0, 19.8.8, (i)). One therefore deduces from (6.11.2) that one has
$coprof_{\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{q}}}(\hat{M}_{\mathfrak{q}}) \leq coprof_{\hat{A}}(\hat{M})$; finally, one knows that
$coprof_{\hat{A}}(\hat{M}) = coprof_{A}(M)$ (0, 16.4.10), which completes the proof of (6.11.5).

This proposition justifies the definition of the codepth of an $A$-module when $A$ is not a local ring, given in
(5.7.12).

**Proposition (6.11.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.6 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module, $n$ an integer $> 0$.
Suppose that for every integral closed sub-prescheme $Y$ of $X$, there exists a non-empty open part $W$ of $Y$ such that
the sub-prescheme of $Y$ induced on the open set $W$ satisfies $(S_{n})$. Then the set $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is open
in $X$.*

<!-- original page 161 -->

The question being local on $X$, one may restrict to the case where $X$ is Noetherian. We shall reason by induction on
$n$: for $n = 1$, the set $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F})$ is open in $X$, for the set of $x \in X$ where $\mathcal{F}$ does not
satisfy $(S_{1})$ is the set of $x$ such that $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ admits embedded associated prime ideals (5.7.5); if
$(Z_{\lambda})$ is the finite family of prime cycles associated with $\mathcal{F}$ which are embedded, one has
consequently $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F}) = X - \bigcup Z_{\lambda}$, whence our assertion since the $Z_{\lambda}$ are
closed. We shall therefore suppose henceforth that $n > 1$. In the second place, one may restrict to the case where
$Supp(\mathcal{F}) = X$, for there is a closed sub-prescheme $T$ of $X$ with $Supp(\mathcal{F})$ as underlying space,
and a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{T}$-Module $\mathcal{F}'$ such that $\mathcal{F} = j_{*}(\mathcal{F}')$, $j : T \to X$
being the canonical injection (Err_III, 30); since it amounts to the same to prove that $\mathcal{F}$ or $\mathcal{F}'$
satisfies $(S_{n})$ at a point $x \in Supp(\mathcal{F})$, one may restrict to considering the case where $T = X$. Note
finally that by definition (5.7.2), $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ is stable under generization. We shall use the following
lemma:

**Lemma (6.11.6.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.6.1 -->

*Let $X$ be a Noetherian space in which every irreducible closed part admits a generic point, $E$ a part of $X$. For $E$
to be open in $X$, it is necessary and sufficient that $E$ be stable under generization, and that, for every open part
$V$ of $X$ and every irreducible part $Y$ closed in $V$, such that $V - Y \subset E$ and the generic point of $Y$
belongs to $E$, $E \cap Y$ contain a non-empty open part of $Y$.*

One will observe that this criterion entails that of (0_III, 9.2.6) when every irreducible closed part of $X$ admits a
generic point. There is evidently only the sufficiency of the conditions stated to prove.

Consider the interior $U$ of $E$; the closed set $X - U$ is the union of its irreducible components, which are finite in
number and closed in $X$. If one had $E \neq U$, the hypothesis that $E$ is stable under generization would entail that
the generic point $\xi$ of one of the irreducible components of $X - U$ would belong to $E$. Now, $\xi$ belongs to only
one of the irreducible components of $X - U$; if $T$ is the union of the other irreducible components of $X - U$,
$V = X - T$ is open in $X$, union of $U$ and of the set $Y = \bar{\xi} \cap V$ closed in $V$ and irreducible. By
hypothesis $E \cap Y$ contains a part $W$ open in $Y$; one concludes that $U \cup W$ is open in $V$, hence in $X$, which
is absurd since $U$ is supposed to be the interior of $E$.

By virtue of this lemma, one may suppose that there exists in $X$ an integral sub-prescheme $Y$ with generic point $y$
such that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $(S_{n})$ at the point $y$ and at all points of $X - Y$, and it remains to verify that
there exists in $X$ an open neighbourhood of $y$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $(S_{n})$ in this neighbourhood. Let
us then distinguish two cases:

*1Â°* $y$ is a maximal point of $X$; since there exists an open neighbourhood of $y$ meeting no irreducible component of
$X$ other than $\bar{y}$, one may suppose that $X$ is irreducible, hence has the same underlying space as $Y$, so that
$Y$ is defined by the Nilradical of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$, which is nilpotent. On the other hand, one may, replacing $X$ by
an open neighbourhood of $y$, suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is normally flat along $Y$ (6.9.1); it then follows from
(6.10.4) that $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F}) = U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{O}_{Y})$, and since the latter is by hypothesis a
neighbourhood of $y$ in $X$, this proves the proposition in this case.

<!-- original page 162 -->

*2Â°* $y$ is not a maximal point of $X$, in other words (since $Supp(\mathcal{F}) = X$), $\dim(\mathcal{F}_{y})
\geq 1$, hence also $prof(\mathcal{F}_{y}) \geq 1$ since $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies by hypothesis $(S_{n})$ (and *a
fortiori* $(S_{1})$) at the point $y$. Replacing $X$ if necessary by an open neighbourhood of $y$, one may therefore
suppose that there exists a section $f$ of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ above $X$, $\mathcal{F}$-regular and such that $f \in
\mathfrak{m}_{y}$, or also $f(y) = 0$ (0, 15.2.4); one therefore has again $f(x) = 0$ for every $x \in Y$ (0_I, 5.5.2).
One knows that $\mathcal{F}/f\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $(S_{n-1})$ at the point $y$ (5.7.6). Applying the inductive
hypothesis, and replacing $X$ if necessary by an open neighbourhood of $y$, one may therefore suppose that
$\mathcal{F}/f\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $(S_{n-1})$ at every point of $X$. But for every $x \in Y$, the relation $f(x) = 0$
entails that one has $prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}/f\mathcal{F}_{x}) = prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) - 1$ and
$\dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}/f\mathcal{F}_{x}) = \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}) - 1$ (0, 16.3.4 and 16.4.6); the relation

$$ prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}/f\mathcal{F}_{x}) \ge \inf(n - 1, \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x}/f\mathcal{F}_{x})) $$

is therefore equivalent to

$$ prof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) \ge \inf(n, \dim(\mathcal{F}_{x})). $$

Since one has supposed that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $(S_{n})$ at every point of $X - Y$, this completes the proof.

**Corollary (6.11.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.7 -->

*The notation being that of (6.11.6):*

*(i) The set $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F})$ is open in $X$.*

*(ii) For the set $U_{S_{2}}(\mathcal{F})$ to be open, it suffices that every maximal point $x$ of $Supp(\mathcal{F})$
belonging to $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F})$ be interior to $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F})$.*

Assertion (i) was proved in the course of the proof of (6.11.6); on the other hand, for $n = 2$ case *2Â°* of the proof
of (6.11.6) is valid without any hypothesis on $X$, since (with the same notation) $U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F})$ and
$U_{S_{1}}(\mathcal{F}/f\mathcal{F})$ are open in $X$. As to case *1Â°* of this proof, the hypothesis precisely assures
that it is unnecessary to consider it.

**Proposition (6.11.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.8 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme satisfying the following property:*

*(CMU) Every integral closed sub-prescheme $Y$ of $X$ contains a non-empty open set $W$ such that the prescheme induced
by $Y$ on $W$ is a Cohen-Macaulay prescheme.*

*Then, for every coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module $\mathcal{F}$, the function $x \mapsto coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is
locally constructible and upper semi-continuous; the sets $U_{C_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ and $U_{S_{n}}(\mathcal{F})$ are open
in $X$.*

Indeed, let $Y$ be an integral closed sub-prescheme of $X$, of generic point $y$; by virtue of (6.10.6), there is in $Y$
an open neighbourhood $V$ of $y$ such that, for every $x \in V \cap Y$, one has

$$ coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x}) = coprof(\mathcal{F}_{y}) + coprof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}). \tag{6.11.8.1} $$

But by hypothesis there exists a non-empty open set $W$ of $Y$ such that, for $x \in V \cap W$, one has
$coprof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}) = 0$, hence $coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is constant in a neighbourhood of $y$ in $Y$, which
proves that the function $x \mapsto coprof(\mathcal{F}_{x})$ is locally constructible (0_III, 9.3.2); moreover it
follows then from (6.11.5) and from (0_III, 9.3.4) that this function is upper semi-continuous. The last assertion
follows from (6.11.4, (i)), or also from (6.11.6).

**Remarks (6.11.9).**

<!-- label: IV.6.11.9 -->

*(i)* If $X$ satisfies hypothesis (CMU) of (6.11.8), then, for every morphism $u : X' \to X$ locally of finite type,
$X'$ also satisfies (CMU). Indeed, let $Y'$ be an integral closed sub-prescheme of $X'$, $y'$ its generic point, $y =
u(y')$, and let $Y$ be the integral sub-prescheme of $X$ having $\bar{y}$ as underlying space; then $u|Y'$ factors as
$Y' \to^{v} Y \to^{j} X$, where $j$ is the canonical injection (I, 5.2.2), and $v$ is locally of finite type (I, 6.6.6).
By restricting to affine open neighbourhoods of $y$ and $y'$ respectively, one may therefore restrict to the case where
$X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $A$ an integral Cohen-Macaulay ring, and $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$, where $A'$ is an
integral ring

<!-- original page 163 -->

containing $A$ and which is an $A$-algebra of finite type. Replacing $A$ if necessary by a ring of fractions $A_{f}$
(with $f \neq 0$), one may moreover suppose that $A'$ contains a polynomial ring $A[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}] = A''$, and is
a finite $A''$-algebra (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §3, nÂ° 1, cor. 1 of th. 1). But $A''$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring
(6.3.6); so one may restrict to the case where moreover $A'$ is a finite $A$-algebra. There is then $g \neq 0$ in $A$
such that $A'_{g}$ is a free $A_{g}$-module of finite type (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. II, §5, nÂ° 1, cor. of prop.
2), hence one may suppose moreover that $A'$ is a free $A$-module. But then $A'$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module (0,
16.5.1), and since $A'$ is an $A$-module of finite type, $A'$ is also a Cohen-Macaulay $A'$-module (0, 16.5.3), hence a
Cohen-Macaulay ring.

*(ii)* Suppose there exists a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module $\mathcal{F}$ such that $Supp(\mathcal{F}) = X$ and
$\mathcal{F}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-Module. Then $X$ satisfies the condition (CMU): indeed, with the
notation of the proof of (6.11.8), the relation (6.11.8.1) shows that one has $coprof(\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}) = 0$ in a
neighbourhood (with respect to $Y$) of the generic point $y$ of $Y$.

One does not know whether there exist locally Noetherian preschemes of dimension $\geq 2$ which do not satisfy (CMU) (if
$\dim(X) = 1$, it is immediate that every maximal point of $X_{red}$ admits an integral open neighbourhood of dimension
$1$, hence Cohen-Macaulay).

## 6.12. Nagata's criteria for $Reg(X)$ to be open

**(6.12.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.1 -->

Given a locally Noetherian prescheme $X$, we call **singular locus** of $X$ and denote by $Sing(X)$ the set of points $x
\in X$ such that $X$ is not regular at the point $x$ (in other words, such that the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is not
regular); the complement $X - Sing(X)$, that is, the set of $x \in X$ where $X$ is regular, is denoted by $Reg(X)$. We
propose in this number to give conditions under which $Sing(X)$ is closed (i.e. $Reg(X)$ is open).

**Proposition (6.12.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.2 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme. The following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) $Reg(X)$ is open in $X$.*

*b) For every $x \in Reg(X)$, there exists a non-empty open subset of $\bar{x}$ contained in $Reg(X)$.*

*Moreover, these conditions are entailed by the following:*

*c) For every $x \in Reg(X)$, if one denotes by $Y$ the reduced closed sub-prescheme of $X$ having $\bar{x}$ as
underlying space, $Reg(Y)$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $Y$.*

The equivalence of a) and b) follows from the fact that $Reg(X)$ is stable under generization (0, 17.3.2) and from
$(0_{III}, 9.2.6)$. To prove that c) entails b), one may restrict to the case where $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is an
affine open neighbourhood of $x$; if $(t_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is a regular system of parameters (0, 17.1.6) of the
regular local ring $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, one may suppose (replacing $X$ if necessary by an open neighbourhood of $x$) that
$t_{i} = (s_{i})_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for every $i$, where $s_{i} \in A$ and where the family $(s_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is
$A$-regular (0, 15.2.4). One has then $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A/\mathfrak{p})$, where $\mathfrak{p} = j_{x}$; as the
$t_{i}$ generate the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{p}A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, one may again
suppose (replacing $X$ by a smaller neighbourhood of $x$) that the $s_{i}$ generate $\mathfrak{p}$. For every $y \in Y$,
the $(s_{i})_{y}$ therefore generate $\mathfrak{p}_{y}$; as they form an $A_{y}$-regular sequence, they form part of a
system of parameters of $A_{y}$ (0, 16.4.1); hence one deduces from (0, 17.1.7) that if $(A/\mathfrak{p})_{y} =
A_{y}/\mathfrak{p}_{y}$ is regular, the same holds for $A_{y}$, whence the conclusion.

**Corollary (6.12.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.3 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme. The following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) For every sub-prescheme $Y$ of $X$, $Reg(Y)$ is open in $Y$.*

<!-- original page 164 -->

*b) For every integral closed sub-prescheme $Y$ of $X$, $Reg(Y)$ contains a non-empty open subset of $Y$.*

It is clear that a) entails b), for if $Y$ is integral and $y$ is its generic point, $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$ is a field, so
$y \in Reg(Y)$. Conversely, to see that b) entails a), consider an integral closed sub-prescheme $Z$ of $Y$ of generic
point $z$; if $Y'$ is the integral sub-prescheme of $X$ having for underlying space the closure $Y' = \bar{z}$ of $z$ in
$X$, then $Z$ is open in $Y'$ and the sub-prescheme $Z$ of $Y'$, being reduced, is induced by $Y'$ on the open set $Z$
of the underlying space of $Y'$. Now the hypothesis entails that $Reg(Y')$ is a neighbourhood of $z$ in $Y'$, hence
$Reg(Z)$ is a neighbourhood of $z$ in $Z$; it then suffices to apply (6.12.2) with $Y$ replaced by $Z$ and $X$ by $Y$.

**Theorem (6.12.4) (Nagata).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.4 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) For every prescheme $X'$ locally of finite type over $X$, $Reg(X')$ is open in $X'$.*

*b) For every finite integral $A$-algebra $A'$, there exists a non-empty open subset of $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$
contained in $Reg(X')$.*

*c) For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ and every finite radicial extension $K'$ of the fraction field $K$ of
$A/\mathfrak{p}$, there exists a sub-$A$-algebra $A'$ of $K'$, finite over $A$, having $K'$ as fraction field, and such
that there exists in $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$ a non-empty open set contained in $Reg(X')$.*

It is clear that a) implies b). To see that b) entails c), it suffices to remark that one may take as generators of the
extension $K'$ of $K$ elements integral over $A/\mathfrak{p}$ (and *a fortiori* over $A$), and since these elements are
finite in number, they generate a finite $A$-algebra $A'$ of which $K'$ is the fraction field; one may then apply b) to
$A'$. It remains to prove that c) entails a). The question being local on $X'$, one may first suppose that $X' =
\operatorname{Spec}(A')$, where $A'$ is an $A$-algebra of finite type; in view of (6.12.2), it suffices to prove that
for every integral closed sub-prescheme $Y'$ of $X'$, $Reg(Y')$ contains a non-empty open subset of $Y'$. In other
words, one may restrict to proving that if $A'$ is an integral $A$-algebra of finite type and $X' =
\operatorname{Spec}(A')$, then $Reg(X')$ contains a non-empty open subset of $X'$. Let $K'$ be the fraction field of
$A'$; if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the canonical image in $X$ of the generic point of $X'$, $K'$ is an extension of the fraction
field $K$ of $A/\mathfrak{p}$, and $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is identified with a sub-ring of $A'$, $A'$ being an
$(A/\mathfrak{p})$-algebra of finite type. One may evidently restrict in what follows to the case $\mathfrak{p} = 0$.
Distinguish now two cases:

**I)** $K'$ is a separable extension of $K$. — One is then reduced to proving the

**Lemma (6.12.4.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.4.1 -->

*Let $A$ be an integral Noetherian ring, $A'$ an integral $A$-algebra of finite type, containing $A$ and such that the
fraction field $K'$ of $A'$ is a separable extension of the fraction field $K$ of $A$. If $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$
contains a non-empty open set formed of regular points, the same holds for $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$.*

Replacing $A$ by a ring of fractions $A_{f}$ such that $D(f) \subset Reg(\operatorname{Spec}(A))$, one may already
suppose the ring $A$ regular. By hypothesis there exists in $K'$ a system $(t_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ of elements
algebraically independent over $K$ and such that $K'$ is a finite separable algebraic extension of $K(t_{1}, \cdots,
t_{n})$; by considering a finite system

<!-- original page 165 -->

of generators $t'_{j}$ ($1 \leq j \leq m$) of $K'$ over $K(t_{1}, \cdots, t_{n})$, which one may suppose integral over
$A_{1} = A[t_{1}, \cdots, t_{n}]$, one sees that $A'_{1} = A_{1}[t'_{1}, \cdots, t'_{m}]$ is finite over $A_{1}$ and has
$K'$ as fraction field. If one sets $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$, $X'_{1} = \operatorname{Spec}(A'_{1})$, it follows
from the fact that the fields of rational functions $R(X')$ and $R(X'_{1})$ are both isomorphic to $K'$, and from the
fact that $X'$ and $X'_{1}$ are $A$-preschemes of finite type, that there exists an open set $U' \subset X'$ and an open
set $U'_{1} \subset X'_{1}$ which are $A$-isomorphic (I, 6.5.5). One is therefore reduced to proving that $Reg(X'_{1})$
contains a non-empty open set; in other words one may suppose that $A'$ is a finite $A_{1}$-algebra. Now one knows (0,
17.3.7) that $A_{1}$ is a regular ring, and one may therefore restrict to the case where $A'$ is a finite $A$-algebra
and $K'$ a finite separable extension of $K$. If $\xi$ is the generic point of $X$, $A'_{\xi} = K'$ is then a free
module over $A_{\xi} = K$, hence (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. II, §5, nÂ° 1, cor. of prop. 2\) one may,
replacing $A$ if necessary by an $A_{f}$, suppose that $A'$ is a free $A$-module of finite type. Let then $(x_{i})_{1
\leq i \leq r}$ be a basis of this $A$-module, and set

$$ d = det(Tr_{A'/A}(x_{i} x_{j})) = det(Tr_{K'/K}(x_{i} x_{j})) \in A. \tag{6.12.4.2} $$

Since $K'$ is separable over $K$, one knows (Bourbaki, *Alg.*, chap. IX, §2, prop. 5) that $d \neq 0$; replacing $A$ if
necessary by the ring of fractions $A_{d}$, one may suppose $d$ invertible in $A$. But then, for every $x \in
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, if one denotes by $\bar{x}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq r$) the canonical image of $x_{i}$ in $A'(x) =
A' \otimes_{A} k(x)$, one has $det(Tr_{A'(x)/k(x)}(\bar{x}_{i} \bar{x}_{j})) = \bar{d}$, the canonical image of $d$ in
$k(x) = A_{x}/\mathfrak{m}_{x}$; and since $\bar{d}$ is invertible (hence $\neq 0$) in $k(x)$, one knows (*loc. cit.*)
that $A'(x)$ is a separable $k(x)$-algebra, hence a direct composition of fields, finite separable extensions of $k(x)$.
Such an algebra being a regular ring, one sees that the morphism $g : X' \to X$ is flat and that its fibres $g^{-1}(x)$
are regular for every $x \in X$; one then concludes from (6.5.2, (ii)) that $X'$ is regular, which terminates the proof
in this case.

**II)** *General case.* — As $A'$ is a torsion-free $A$-module, $A' \otimes_{A} K$ is identified with a sub-ring of
$K'$, hence $X'' = \operatorname{Spec}(A' \otimes_{A} K)$ is an integral $K$-prescheme of which $K'$ is the field of
rational functions. One knows (4.6.6) that there exists a finite radicial extension $K_{1}$ of $K$ such that if $X''_{1}
= \operatorname{Spec}(A' \otimes_{A} K_{1}) = X'' \otimes_{K} K_{1}$, then $(X''_{1})_{red}$ is a $K_{1}$-prescheme
geometrically reduced and of finite type; moreover, the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(K_{1}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(K)$
being radicial, finite and surjective, is a universal homeomorphism (2.4.5), hence $X''_{1}$ is homeomorphic to $X''$,
and consequently $(X''_{1})_{red}$ is integral; moreover, its field of rational functions $K'_{1}$ is a finite radicial
extension of $K'$ and a separable extension of finite type of $K_{1}$ (4.6.1). By virtue of hypothesis c) of the
statement, there is a sub-$A$-algebra *finite* $A_{1}$ of $K_{1}$, having $K_{1}$ as fraction field, and such that if
one sets $X_{1} = \operatorname{Spec}(A_{1})$, then $Reg(X_{1})$ contains a non-empty open set of $X_{1}$. Let $A'_{1}$
be the image of the canonical homomorphism $A' \otimes_{A} A_{1} \to K'_{1}$, and set $X'_{1} =
\operatorname{Spec}(A'_{1})$; $A'_{1}$ is an integral ring which is a finite $A$-algebra and whose fraction field is
$K'_{1}$ by construction; moreover, as the composite homomorphism $A' \to A' \otimes_{A} A_{1} \to A'_{1} \to K'_{1}$ is
identical to $A' \to K' \to K'_{1}$, hence injective, the homomorphism $A' \to A'_{1}$ is injective; the morphism $g :
X'_{1} \to X'$ is therefore finite and surjective (II, 6.1.10). This being so, the hypothesis on $A_{1}$ and Part I) of
the proof entail that $Reg(X'_{1})$

<!-- original page 166 -->

contains a non-empty open set $V'_{1}$; as $g$ is closed (II, 6.1.10), one may suppose that $V'_{1} = g^{-1}(V')$, where
$V'$ is an affine open set of $X'$; replacing $A'$ by the ring of $V'$ and $A'_{1}$ by that of $V'_{1}$, one may
therefore suppose that $X'_{1}$ is regular. Moreover, the same reasoning as in I) applied to the generic point $\xi'$ of
$X'$ allows one (replacing $X'$ if necessary by a neighbourhood of $\xi'$) to suppose that $A'_{1}$ is a free
$A'$-module, and consequently that the morphism $g$ is flat. But it then follows from (6.5.2, (i)) that $X'$ is regular.
Q.E.D.

**Corollary (6.12.5) (Zariski).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.5 -->

*Let $k$ be a field; for every $k$-prescheme $X$ locally of finite type over $k$, the set of $x \in X$ where $X$ is
regular (resp. geometrically regular over $k$) is open in $X$.*

The assertion of the corollary concerning the property of being regular follows from (6.12.4) by taking $A = k$. The
assertion concerning the property of being geometrically regular already follows from (6.8.7); one may also deduce it
from (6.12.4) in the following way. Set $k' = k^{p^{-}\infty}$ ($p$ characteristic exponent of $k$); as the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(k') \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$ is radicial, integral and surjective, it is a universal
homeomorphism (2.4.5), hence the projection morphism $X \otimes_{k} k' \to X$ is a homeomorphism. The projection in $X$
of $Reg(X \otimes_{k} k')$ is the set of points of $X$ where $X$ is geometrically regular over $k$, by virtue of (6.7.7,
e)), hence this set is open by what precedes.

**Corollary (6.12.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.6 -->

*Let $A$ be a ring having one of the following properties:*

*(i) $A$ is a Dedekind ring and its fraction field $K$ is of characteristic $0$.*

*(ii) $A$ is a Noetherian semi-local ring of dimension $\leq 1$.*

*Then, for every prescheme $X$ locally of finite type over $A$, $Reg(X)$ is open in $X$.*

Let us verify in both cases condition c) of (6.12.4). In both cases, a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ is maximal or
minimal; if $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal, a finite integral $(A/\mathfrak{p})$-algebra is a field, and condition c) of
(6.12.4) is trivially verified. Suppose then $\mathfrak{p}$ not maximal, and distinguish the two cases of the statement.

(i) If $K$ is of characteristic $0$, there is no radicial extension of $K$ other than $K$ itself; as a Dedekind ring is
regular (0, 17.1.4), condition c) of (6.12.4) is trivially verified.

(ii) One may then suppose $A$ integral (6.12.2); let $K$ be its fraction field; if $K'$ is a finite radicial extension
of $K$, and $A'$ a sub-$A$-algebra of $K'$ generated by a finite system of generators of $K'$ over $K$, integral over
$A$, then $A'$ is a semi-local integral ring of dimension $1$ (0, 16.1.5), and consequently, in $X' =
\operatorname{Spec}(A')$, the set reduced to the generic point is open and evidently contained in $Reg(X')$, which
proves condition c) of (6.12.4) in this case.

This corollary applies notably when $A = \mathbb{Z}$.

**Theorem (6.12.7) (Nagata).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.7 -->

*Let $A$ be a complete Noetherian local ring, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. Then $Reg(X)$ is open in $X$.*

In view of (6.12.2), one is reduced to the case where $A$ is moreover integral, and to proving that in this case
$Reg(X)$ contains a non-empty open subset of $X$. Distinguish

<!-- original page 167 -->

two cases:

**I)** *The fraction field $K$ of $A$ is of characteristic $0$.* — One knows then (0, 19.8.8) that there exists a
complete discrete valuation ring $C$ and a sub-ring $B$ of $A$ such that $A$ is a finite $B$-algebra and $B$ is
isomorphic to a ring of formal series $C[[T_{1}, \cdots, T_{n}]]$. Since $C$ is regular (II, 7.1.6), the same holds for
$B$ (0, 17.3.8); moreover, the fraction field $L$ of $B$ being of characteristic $0$, $K$ is a finite separable
extension of $L$, hence one may apply (6.12.4.1) to $B$, and this then proves the proposition.

**II)** *The fraction field $K$ of $A$ is of characteristic $p > 0$.* — Then $A$ contains the prime field
$\mathbb{F}_{p}$, and the theorem was proved in this case in (0, 22.7.6).

**Corollary (6.12.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.8 -->

*Let $A$ be a complete Noetherian local ring. Then, for every prescheme $X$ locally of finite type over $A$, $Reg(X)$ is
open in $X$.*

Let us verify condition c) of (6.12.4). If $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime in $A$, $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is still a complete
Noetherian local ring; if $K'$ is a finite extension of the fraction field $K$ of $A/\mathfrak{p}$, then $K'$ is the
fraction field of a finite sub-$A$-algebra $A'$ of $K'$, generated by a system of generators of $K'$ over $K$, integral
over $A$. One knows then that $A'$ is a complete semi-local ring (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. IV, §2, nÂ° 5, cor. 3 of
prop. 9), hence a product of complete local rings, and since $A'$ is integral, it is a complete local ring; by virtue of
(6.12.7), if $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$, $Reg(X')$ is open and non-empty, whence the conclusion.

**Proposition (6.12.9).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.9 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme such that $Reg(X)$ is open; then, for every $n \geq 0$, the set
$U_{R_{n}}(X)$ of points $x \in X$ where $X$ satisfies $(R_{n})$ is open.*

Indeed (5.8.2), $U_{R_{n}}(X)$ is the union of $Reg(X)$ and of the set of $x \in Sing(X)$ such that the generic points
$z$ of the irreducible components of $Sing(X)$ containing $x$ satisfy the relation $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x,z}) \geq n + 1$
(since one has $z \notin Reg(X)$); in other words, these points $x \in Sing(X)$ are those for which $codim_{x}(Sing(X),
X) \geq n + 1$ (0, 14.2.1); as the function $x \mapsto codim_{x}(Sing(X), X)$ is lower semi-continuous (0, 14.2.6), the
set of these points is open in $Sing(X)$, which completes the proof.

Let us also note the following elementary result:

**Proposition (6.12.10).**

<!-- label: IV.6.12.10 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme. The set $U_{R_{0}}(X)$ is open in $X$. For $U_{S_{1}}(X)$ to be open in $X$,
it is necessary and sufficient that every maximal point $x \in X$ such that $x \in U_{S_{1}}(X)$ (which means that $X$
is reduced at $x$) be interior to $U_{S_{1}}(X)$.*

By definition (5.8.2), $U_{R_{0}}(X)$ is the set $X - \bigcup X_{\lambda}$, where $X_{\lambda}$ runs through the set of
irreducible components of $X$ such that $X$ is not reduced at their generic point;

<!-- original page 168 -->

as the set of irreducible components of $X$ is locally finite, $U_{R_{0}}(X)$ is open. Concerning $U_{S_{1}}(X)$, the
condition of the statement being trivially necessary, let us prove that it is sufficient. Let $X_{\mu}$ be the
irreducible components of $X$ such that at their generic point $x_{\mu}$ the prescheme $X$ is reduced; by hypothesis
there exists an open set $U \subset U_{S_{1}}(X)$ containing all the $x_{\mu}$. Denote then by $Z_{\lambda}$ the
irreducible components of the closed set $Z = X - U$ whose generic point $z_{\lambda}$ is such that
$\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x,z_{\lambda}}) \geq 1$ and such that $\mathcal{O}_{z_{\lambda}}$ is non-regular. No point belonging
to one of the $Z_{\lambda}$ can belong to $U_{S_{1}}(X)$; but conversely, if $x \in Z$ belongs to none of the
$Z_{\lambda}$, then, for every generization $x'$ of $x$, either $x' \in U$, or one has $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x,x'}) \geq
2$, or one has $\dim(\mathcal{O}_{x,x'}) = 1$, and as $x'$ belongs to none of the $Z_{\lambda}$, $\bar{x'}$ is
necessarily an irreducible component of $Z$, of codimension $1$ in $X$, distinct from the $Z_{\lambda}$, hence
$\mathcal{O}_{x'}$ is regular by definition. One concludes that $U_{S_{1}}(X) = X - \bigcup Z_{\lambda}$; as the set of
$Z_{\lambda}$ is locally finite in $Z$, $\bigcup Z_{\lambda}$ is closed, which completes the proof that $U_{S_{1}}(X)$
is open in $X$.

## 6.13. Criteria for $Nor(X)$ to be open

**(6.13.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.1 -->

Given a locally Noetherian prescheme $X$, we shall denote by $Nor(X)$ the set of $x \in X$ where $X$ is normal; this set
contains $Reg(X)$ and is contained in the (open) set of points $x$ such that $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is integral (i.e. the set
of points $x$ where $X$ is reduced, and which belong to a single irreducible component of $X$).

**Proposition (6.13.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.2 -->

*Let $X$ be a reduced locally Noetherian prescheme, $X'$ its normalization (II, 6.3.8). If the canonical morphism $f :
X' \to X$ is finite, $Nor(X)$ is open in $X$.*

Indeed, one has $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X'}))$ and $f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X'})$ is a coherent
$\mathcal{O}_{X}$-algebra by hypothesis (II, 6.1.3). To say that $X$ is normal at a point $x$ means that the canonical
homomorphism $\mathcal{O}_{x} \to (f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X'}))_{x}$ is bijective (II, 6.3.4); but the set of these points
is open since $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ and $f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X'})$ are coherent $(0_{I}, 5.2.7)$.

**Corollary (6.13.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.3 -->

*If $A$ is a Japanese integral Noetherian ring, $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A))$ is open in $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.*

**Proposition (6.13.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.4 -->

*Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme. For $Nor(X)$ to be open, it is necessary and sufficient that every maximal
point $x$ of $X$ such that $x \in Nor(X)$ (which means that $X$ is reduced at the point $x$) be interior to $Nor(X)$.*

There is only the sufficiency of the condition to prove. By virtue of the remark made in (6.13.1), one may restrict
(replacing $X$ by an open subset of $X$ in which $X$ is reduced) to the case where $X$ is reduced, i.e. suppose that the
maximal points of $X$ belong to $U_{S_{2}}(X)$ and to $U_{R_{1}}(X)$; as $Nor(X) = U_{S_{2}}(X) \cap U_{R_{1}}(X)$ by
virtue of Serre's criterion (5.8.6), one deduces therefore from (6.11.7) and (6.12.10) that these two sets are open;
consequently $Nor(X)$ is open in $X$.

**Corollary (6.13.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.5 -->

*If $X$ is such that $Reg(X)$ is open in $X$, then $Nor(X)$ is open in $X$.*

Indeed, every maximal point $x$ where $X$ is reduced (hence $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ a field) belongs to $Reg(X)$, hence is
interior to $Reg(X)$ by hypothesis, and *a fortiori* interior to $Nor(X)$.

**Proposition (6.13.6) (Nagata).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.6 -->

*Let $A$ be an integral Noetherian ring, $K$ its fraction field, $K'$ a finite extension of $K$, $A'$ the integral
closure of $A$ in $K'$. For $A'$ to be a finite $A$-algebra, it is necessary and sufficient that the following two
conditions be satisfied:*

*(i) There exists $f \neq 0$ in $A$ such that the integral closure $A'_{f}$ of the ring of fractions $A_{f}$ in $K'$ is
a finite $A_{f}$-algebra.*

<!-- original page 169 -->

*(ii) For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, the integral closure $A'_{\mathfrak{p}}$ of the
local ring $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ in $K'$ is a finite $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-algebra.*

The conditions are necessary, for, for every multiplicative subset $S$ of $A$, $S^{-1}A'$ is the integral closure of
$S^{-1}A$ in $K'$ and is by hypothesis a finitely generated $S^{-1}A$-module. To see that the conditions are sufficient,
consider the increasing filtered family $(B_{\lambda})$ of the sub-$A$-algebras of $K'$ which are finite $A$-algebras
and have $K'$ as fraction field. Set $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $X_{\lambda} = \operatorname{Spec}(B_{\lambda})$,
denote by $u_{\lambda}$ the morphism $X_{\lambda} \to Y$, and let $S_{\lambda} = X_{\lambda} - Nor(X_{\lambda})$,
$T_{\lambda} = u_{\lambda}(S_{\lambda})$. One may restrict to the $B_{\lambda}$ containing a finite set whose image in
$A'$ is a system of generators of the $A_{f}$-module $A'_{f}$; this entails, by virtue of hypothesis (i), that
$(B_{\lambda})_{f} = A'_{f}$ for every $\lambda$, or also that $u^{-1}_{\lambda}(D(f))$ is contained in
$Nor(X_{\lambda})$. By virtue of (6.13.2), $S_{\lambda}$ is therefore closed in $X_{\lambda}$, and as $u_{\lambda}$ is a
finite morphism, $T_{\lambda}$ is closed in $Y$. But for every $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, there exists
by virtue of (ii) a $\lambda$ such that $(B_{\lambda})_{\mathfrak{p}} = A'_{\mathfrak{p}}$, and consequently all points
of $X_{\lambda}$ over $\mathfrak{p}$ belong to $Nor(X_{\lambda})$; in other words, one has $\bigcap T_{\lambda} =
\emptyset$; as $Y$ is Noetherian and the $T_{\lambda}$ are closed, there exists a $\lambda$ such that $T_{\lambda} =
\emptyset$; hence $B_{\lambda}$ is integrally closed, and as its fraction field is $K'$, one has $B_{\lambda} = A'$.
Q.E.D.

**Proposition (6.13.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.7 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) For every prescheme $X'$ locally of finite type over $X$, $Nor(X')$ is open in $X'$.*

*b) For every finite integral $A$-algebra $A'$, $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A'))$ is open in $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$.*

*c) For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ and every finite radicial extension $K'$ of the fraction field $K$ of
$A/\mathfrak{p}$, there exists a sub-$A$-algebra $A'$ of $K'$, finite over $A$, having $K'$ as fraction field and such
that $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A'))$ is open in $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$.*

The fact that a) implies b) and that b) implies c) is proved as in (6.12.4). To show that c) entails a), in view of
(6.13.2), one reduces as in (6.12.4) to proving that if $A'$ is an integral $A$-algebra of finite type, the generic
point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$ is interior to $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A'))$. One then distinguishes two cases as in
(6.12.4), first proving the

**Lemma (6.13.7.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.13.7.1 -->

*Let $A$ be an integral Noetherian ring, $A'$ an integral $A$-algebra of finite type, containing $A$ and such that the
fraction field $K'$ of $A'$ is a separable extension of the fraction field $K$ of $A$. If $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A))$
is open in $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A'))$ is open in $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$.*

It is a question of proving (in view of (6.13.2)) that the generic point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$ is interior to
$Nor(\operatorname{Spec}(A'))$. The proof follows the same course as that of (6.12.4.1), whose notations we retain. One
remarks first that one may suppose that $A$ is integrally closed, and then one knows that $A_{1} = A[t_{1}, \cdots,
t_{n}]$ is integrally closed (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §1, nÂ° 3, cor. 2 of prop. 13); one then reduces to the
case where $A'$ is a free $A$-module of finite type; the reasoning of (6.12.4.1) then proves (replacing $A$ if necessary
by a ring $A_{f}$ with $f \neq 0$) that the fibres $g^{-1}(x)$ of the morphism $g : X' \to X$ are regular and *a
fortiori* normal. Moreover $g$ is flat and $X$ is normal, hence (6.5.4, (ii)) $X'$ is normal.

This lemma being proved, one passes to the general case as in (6.12.4; II)), whose notations we again retain; applying
hypothesis c), one sees this time that $Nor(X_{1})$ is open and one thus reduces to the case where $X_{1}$ is normal and
$g : X'_{1} \to X'$ flat and surjective; one concludes this time that $X'$ is normal by means of (6.5.4, (i)).

## 6.14. Base change and integral closure

**Proposition (6.14.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.1 -->

*Let $Y$, $Y'$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $g : Y' \to Y$ a normal morphism (6.8.1). Then, for every normal
$Y$-prescheme $X$, the prescheme $X' = X \times_{Y} Y'$ is normal.*

Note that in this statement one does not suppose $X$ locally Noetherian.

**Lemma (6.14.1.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.1.1 -->

*Let $R$ be a ring direct composition of a finite number of fields.*

<!-- original page 170 -->

*(i) For a sub-ring $A$ of $R$ having $R$ as total ring of fractions to be normal, it is necessary and sufficient that
it be integrally closed in $R$.*

*(ii) Let $(A_{\lambda})$ be a family of normal sub-rings of $R$; if $A = \bigcap A_{\lambda}$ admits $R$ as total ring
of fractions, then $A$ is normal.*

(i) Since $A$ is a sub-ring of $R$, $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a sub-ring of $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for every prime ideal
$\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, and $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a ring of fractions of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$; moreover $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$
is necessarily a direct composition of a finite number of fields, hence every non-zero-divisor in $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is
invertible; this proves that $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is the total ring of fractions of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. If $A$ is
integrally closed in $R$, $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is therefore integrally closed in $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$; but if
$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a direct composition of at least two fields, the integral closure of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ in
$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a direct composition of at least two rings not reduced to $0$, which is absurd since
$A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a local ring; hence $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is necessarily a field and $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is integral
and integrally closed, which by definition means that $A$ is normal. Conversely, if $A$ is normal, $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$,
the total ring of fractions of an integral ring $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, is a field, and $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is integrally
closed in $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$; if $x \in R$ is an element integral over $A$, its image in each $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is
integral over $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, hence belongs to $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$; one concludes that $x \in A$ (Bourbaki, *Alg.
comm.*, chap. II, §3, nÂ° 3, cor. 1 of th. 1), and consequently $A$ is integrally closed in $R$.

(ii) Since $A \subset A_{\lambda} \subset R$ for every $\lambda$, $R$ is also the total ring of fractions of each
$A_{\lambda}$. In view of the characterization of normal rings having $R$ as total ring of fractions given in (i),
assertion (ii) follows from Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §1, nÂ° 3, prop. 12.

This lemma being proved, the proof of (6.14.1) proceeds in several steps.

**I)** *Reduction to the case where $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $Y' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$, $X =
\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, $A$, $A'$ being Noetherian local rings, $A$ integral, $B$ the integral closure of $A$.* — It is
a question of proving that for every $x' \in X'$, the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{x'}$ is integral and integrally closed;
let $x$, $y$, $y'$ be the canonical images of $x'$ in $X$, $Y$, $Y'$ respectively; if one sets $A = \mathcal{O}_{y}$,
$A' = \mathcal{O}_{y'}$, $B = \mathcal{O}_{x}$, the rings $\mathcal{O}_{x'}$ for $x$, $y$, $y'$ fixed are the local
rings at the prime ideals of the ring $B' = B \otimes_{A} A'$ (I, 3.6.5), and it is therefore a question of proving that
$B'$ is a normal ring. Note moreover that $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is a normal morphism by
definition (6.8.1 and I, 3.6.5); one is therefore reduced to the case where $Y$ and $Y'$ are local schemes, $X$ the
spectrum of an integrally closed integral local ring $B$. Denote by $(B_{\alpha})$ the family of integral closures of
the sub-$A$-algebras of finite type of $B$; it is clear that $B$ is the union of the filtered increasing family of the
$B_{\alpha}$. Since the functor $\varinjlim$ commutes with tensor product, $B'$ is therefore isomorphic to $\lim
B'_{\alpha}$, where one has set $B'_{\alpha} = B_{\alpha} \otimes_{A} A'$. To prove that $B'$ is normal, it will
suffice, by virtue of (5.13.6), to show that the rings $B'_{\alpha}$ are normal and that, for $\alpha \leq \beta$, every
irreducible component of $\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\beta})$ dominates an irreducible component of
$\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\alpha})$. But this latter property follows from the hypothesis that $A'$ is a flat $A$-module
and from (2.3.7, (ii)), since $B_{\alpha}$ and $B_{\beta}$ are integral and $B_{\alpha} \subset B_{\beta}$.

One may therefore restrict to proving that $B' = B \otimes_{A} A'$ is normal when $B$ is

<!-- original page 171 -->

the integral closure of an integral $A$-algebra of finite type $C$; in this case, if one sets $C' = C \otimes_{A} A'$,
the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(C') \to \operatorname{Spec}(C)$ is normal (6.8.2); as $B' = B \otimes_{C} C'$, one
sees that one may replace $A$ and $A'$ by $C$ and $C'$ respectively, hence suppose that $A$ is integral and that $B$ is
the integral closure of $A$. Finally, the procedure of the beginning permits one to restrict to the case where $A$ is
local (taking into account that, if $B$ is the integral closure of $A$, then $B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is the integral closure
of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$).

**II)** *Reduction to the case where $A$ is an integral local ring of dimension $1$, $B$ a discrete valuation ring,
integral closure of $A$, and the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ radicial.* — Let $K$ be
the fraction field of $A$. One knows (0, 23.2.7) that $B$ is the intersection of a family $(V_{\lambda})$ of discrete
valuation rings such that, for every $x \in K$, one has $x \in V_{\lambda}$ except for a finite number of indices
$\lambda$. One has therefore an exact sequence of $A$-modules

$$ 0 \to B \to K \to \bigoplus (K/V_{\lambda}). $$

Set $K' = K \otimes_{A} A'$, $V'_{\lambda} = V_{\lambda} \otimes_{A} A'$; by flatness, one deduces from the preceding
exact sequence a new exact sequence

$$ 0 \to B' \to K' \to \bigoplus (K'/V'_{\lambda}) $$

and consequently $B' = \bigcap V'_{\lambda}$. Moreover $\operatorname{Spec}(K')$ is the fibre of the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ at the generic point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, hence $K'$ is a
Noetherian normal ring, and consequently a direct composition of a finite number of integral and integrally closed
rings; the direct composition $L'$ of the fraction fields of these latter is the total ring of fractions of $A'$, hence
also that of $B'$. One may therefore apply Lemma (6.14.1.1), and if one proves that each of the $V'_{\lambda}$ is a
normal ring, the same will hold for $B'$.

One knows on the other hand (0, 23.2.7) that one may take the $V_{\lambda}$ such that there is a finite sub-$A$-algebra
$C$ of $K$ such that $V_{\lambda}$ is the integral closure of $C_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}}$, where
$\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}$ is a prime ideal of height $1$ in $C$. If one sets $C'_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}} =
C_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}} \otimes_{A} A'$, the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(C'_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}}) \to
\operatorname{Spec}(C_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}})$ is normal (6.8.2) and one has $V'_{\lambda} = V_{\lambda}
\otimes_{C_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}}} C'_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}}$; one may therefore replace $B$ by $V_{\lambda}$ and
$A$ by $C_{\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}}$, hence suppose that $A$ is local, integral and of dimension $1$, $B$ its integral
closure and a discrete valuation ring. There is a finite sub-$A$-algebra $A_{1}$ of $B$ such that the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A_{1})$ is radicial (0, 23.2.5), which entails in particular that
$A_{1}$ is also a local ring (evidently of dimension $1$); moreover one may suppose that $B$ and $A_{1}$ have the same
residue field (*loc. cit.*). One may therefore by the same method replace $A$ by $A_{1}$. Applying if necessary the
procedure of the beginning of I), one may finally suppose that $A'$ is also a local ring and that the homomorphism $A
\to A'$ is local.

**III)** *End of the proof.* — We shall establish first the following lemma:

**Lemma (6.14.1.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.1.2 -->

*Let $A$ be an integral Noetherian local ring of dimension $1$, $A'$ a Noetherian local ring, $A \to A'$ a local
homomorphism such that the corresponding morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is normal. Let
$K$ be the fraction field of $A$, $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of $A$, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field.*

<!-- original page 172 -->

*(i) If $\mathfrak{q}'_{j}$ ($1 \leq j \leq r$) are the minimal prime ideals of $A'$, then $K' = K \otimes_{A} A'$ is a
direct composition of integral and integrally closed rings $K'_{j} \supset A'/\mathfrak{q}'_{j}$ ($1 \leq j \leq r$),
$K'_{j}$ having as fraction field the fraction field $L'_{j}$ of $A'/\mathfrak{q}'_{j}$ ($1 \leq j \leq r$), so that the
total ring of fractions $L'$ of $A'$ is identified with the direct composition of the $L'_{j}$ and $A'$ with a sub-ring
of $K'$.*

*(ii) The ideal $\mathfrak{p}' = \mathfrak{m} A'$ of $A'$ is prime; the ring $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is of dimension $1$
and is identified with a sub-ring of the product of the fields $L'_{j}$ for the indices $j$ such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j}
\subset \mathfrak{p}'$.*

*(iii) If $\hat{A}'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ denotes the sub-ring of $L'$ product of $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ and of the $L'_{j}$
such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j} \not\subset \mathfrak{p}'$, one has*

$$ (6.14.1.3) A' = K' \cap \hat{A}'_{\mathfrak{p}'}. $$

Assertion (i) has already been seen in the course of the proof of II) and is independent of the dimension hypothesis on
$A$. The hypothesis that the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is normal entails that $A'
\otimes_{A} k = A'/\mathfrak{m}A'$ is a normal local Noetherian ring, hence *integral*, which already shows that
$\mathfrak{p}' = \mathfrak{m} A'$ is prime. One has, by (6.1.2), $\dim(A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}) = \dim(A) +
\dim(A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{m} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'})$. But $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{m} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'} =
A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{p}' A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is the residue field of $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, hence
$\dim(A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}) = 1$. The fact that $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is contained in the direct composition of the
$L'_{j}$ such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j} \subset \mathfrak{p}'$ follows from the fact that the ideals $\mathfrak{q}'_{j}
A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ for these indices $j$ are the minimal prime ideals of $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$.

It remains to prove (6.14.1.3). One has evidently $A' \subset K' \cap \hat{A}'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$. Conversely, let $y'$ be
an element of this intersection; let $a$ be a "parameter" for $A$, so that $Aa$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-primary, and let $a'$
be the image of $a$ in $A'$; every element of $K$ may be written $x/a^{n}$ for $x \in A$ and an integer $n > 0$, since
$Aa$ contains a power of $\mathfrak{m}$; hence one may write $y' = x'/a'^{n}$ with $x' \in A'$. Note now that
$\mathfrak{p}'$ is the only prime ideal associated with $A'/a^{n}A' = (A/a^{n}A) \otimes_{A} A'$: as $A'$ is a flat
$A$-module, this follows from (3.3.1), $\mathfrak{m}$ being the only prime ideal associated with $A/a^{n}A$ and $k
\otimes_{A} A'$ being integral. Consequently, $a^{n} A'$ is the inverse image in $A'$ of $a'^{n} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$; as
by hypothesis $y' \in \hat{A}'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, the image of $x'$ in $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ belongs to $a'^{n}
A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$; whence $x' \in a^{n}A'$ and $y' \in A'$, which completes the proof.

This lemma being established, in the case to which we are reduced at the end of II), $B'$ is radicial over $A'$ (I,
3.5.7) and consequently is also a *local* ring; moreover $B'$ is integral over $A'$, hence, if $\mathfrak{q}'$ is the
unique prime ideal of $B'$ above $\mathfrak{p}'$, $\mathfrak{q}' B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is the only maximal ideal of
$B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §2, nÂ° 1, prop. 1), hence $B'_{\mathfrak{q}'} =
B'_{\mathfrak{p}'} = B \otimes_{A} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$. We shall first show that $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is a Noetherian
and normal ring. Now, since $B$ contains $A$ and is contained in $K$ and $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is a flat $A$-module,
$B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ contains $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ and is contained in $K'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, hence in the product $L''$
of the $L'_{j}$ such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j} \subset \mathfrak{p}'$. For every index $j$ such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j}
\not\subset \mathfrak{p}'$, let $\mathfrak{d}'_{j}$ be the product of the $L'_{h}$ such that $h \neq j$, so that
$\mathfrak{d}'_{j} \cap A' = \mathfrak{q}'_{j}$; as every element of $A - \mathfrak{p}'$ is regular in $L''$, one has
also

$$ \mathfrak{d}'_{j} \cap A'_{\mathfrak{p}'} = \mathfrak{q}'_{j} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}. $$

Let $\mathfrak{r}'_{j} = B'_{\mathfrak{p}'} \cap \mathfrak{d}'_{j}$, so that $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{r}'_{j}$ is
isomorphic to the projection of $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ in $L'_{j}$; hence $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{r}'_{j}$ contains
the integral local ring of dimension $1$, $A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}/\mathfrak{q}'_{j} A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, and is contained in
its fraction field $L'_{j}$; it is consequently Noetherian by virtue of the Krull-Akizuki theorem (Bourbaki, *Alg.
comm.*, chap. VII, §2, nÂ° 5, prop. 5).

<!-- original page 173 -->

Since the intersection of the $\mathfrak{r}'_{j}$ is reduced to $0$, one deduces that $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ itself is
Noetherian, by reason of the following classical lemma:

**Lemma (6.14.1.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.1.4 -->

*Let $R$ be a ring, $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ two ideals of $R$; if $R/\mathfrak{a}$ and $R/\mathfrak{b}$ are
Noetherian, the same holds for $R/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$.*

Indeed, let $\mathfrak{c}$ be an ideal of $R$ such that $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{c}$; one has
therefore $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{c} \subset \mathfrak{c}$; now
$\mathfrak{c}/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{c})$ is an $R$-module isomorphic to $(\mathfrak{a} +
\mathfrak{c})/\mathfrak{a}$, hence to an ideal of $R/\mathfrak{a}$, and consequently is of finite type; on the other
hand $(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{c})/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$ is a sub-$R$-module of
$\mathfrak{a}/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$, and this latter is isomorphic to $(\mathfrak{a} +
\mathfrak{b})/\mathfrak{b}$, hence is of finite type as an ideal of $R/\mathfrak{b}$; hence $(\mathfrak{a} \cap
\mathfrak{c})/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$ is also an $R$-module of finite type, and so is
$\mathfrak{c}/(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$.

Note on the other hand that $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ consists of the closed point $\mathfrak{m}$ and the generic point
`(0)`, of residue fields $k$ and $K$ respectively; as in the case in which we have placed ourselves, the fraction field
of $B$ and its residue field are respectively isomorphic to $K$ and $k$, the fibres of the morphism $u :
\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ at the closed point and at the generic point of
$\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ are respectively isomorphic to the fibres of the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(A'_{\mathfrak{p}'}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ at the closed point and at the generic point of
$\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ (I, 3.6.4), hence are geometrically normal by hypothesis; as moreover the morphism $u$ is flat,
one concludes that it is normal (6.8.1). But since $B$ and $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ are Noetherian and $B$ is normal, one
deduces from (6.5.4) that $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is normal.

This being so, $B$ is the union of the increasing filtered family of its finite sub-$A$-algebras $A_{\alpha}$; by
flatness, $B'$ is the union of the increasing filtered family of the $A'_{\alpha} = A_{\alpha} \otimes_{A} A'$; if one
sets $\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha} = \mathfrak{q}' \cap A'_{\alpha}$, $B'_{\mathfrak{q}'}$ is also the union of the increasing
filtered family of the $(A'_{\alpha})_{\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha}}$ (5.13.3). Denote by $L''$ the direct composition of the
fields $L'_{j}$ such that $\mathfrak{q}'_{j} \not\subset \mathfrak{p}'$; then for every $\alpha$,
$(A'_{\alpha})_{\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha}}$ is contained in $K'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, and the ring $B'_{\mathfrak{q}'} \cong
L'' \times B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$ is therefore the union of the rings $L'' \times (A'_{\alpha})_{\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha}} =
(\hat{A}'_{\alpha})_{\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha}}$. But each of the $A_{\alpha}$ is local, Noetherian, integral and of
dimension $1$, and the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(A'_{\alpha}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A_{\alpha})$ is normal
(6.8.2), hence one may apply Lemma (6.14.1.2) to it and one has

$$ A'_{\alpha} = K' \cap (\hat{A}'_{\alpha})_{\mathfrak{p}'_{\alpha}} $$

for every $\alpha$; taking the inductive limit of each of the two members, it comes

$$ B' = K' \cap B'_{\mathfrak{q}'}. $$

But $B'_{\mathfrak{q}'}$, direct composition of the normal rings $L''$ and $B'_{\mathfrak{p}'}$, is normal, and as the
same holds for $K'$, Lemma (6.14.1.1) shows that $B'$ is normal. Q.E.D.

**Corollary (6.14.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.2 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a normal $k$-prescheme (not necessarily locally Noetherian). Then, for every separable
extension $k'$ of $k$, $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$ is normal.*

One knows indeed (6.7.6) that the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(k') \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$ is then normal.

**Corollary (6.14.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.3 -->

*Let $k$ be a field; $X$, $Y$ two integral and normal $k$-preschemes, whose fields of rational functions $K = R(X)$, $L
= R(Y)$ are separable extensions of $k$. Then the prescheme $X \times_{k} Y$ is normal.*

<!-- original page 174 -->

The question being local on $X$ and $Y$, one may suppose that $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are two integral and integrally closed rings, of fraction fields $K$ and $L$
respectively; suppose first that $A$ is a $k$-algebra of finite type, hence $K$ an extension of finite type of $k$. By
flatness, $A \otimes_{k} B$ is a sub-ring of $K \otimes_{k} L$; now $K \otimes_{k} L$ is a Noetherian normal ring (by
virtue of (6.7.4.1) or (6.14.2)), hence direct composition of integral rings $C_{i}$ in finite number, so that if
$E_{i}$ is the fraction field of $C_{i}$, the direct composition $E$ of the $E_{i}$ is the total ring of fractions of $K
\otimes_{k} L$; this is moreover also the total ring of fractions of $A \otimes_{k} B$, since $K \otimes_{k} L$ is a
ring of fractions of $A \otimes_{k} B$. This being so, one may write $A \otimes_{k} B = (A \otimes_{k} L) \cap (K
\otimes_{k} B)$, and it follows from (6.14.2) that $A \otimes_{k} L$ and $K \otimes_{k} B$ are normal, hence $A
\otimes_{k} B$ is normal by virtue of (6.14.1.1).

Consider now the general case; $A$ is then the union of the increasing filtered family of its sub-$k$-algebras of finite
type $A_{\alpha}$, hence $A \otimes_{k} B$ is the inductive limit of the normal rings $A_{\alpha} \otimes_{k} B$. To
prove that $A \otimes_{k} B$ is normal, it suffices therefore (5.13.6) to prove that every irreducible component of
$\operatorname{Spec}(A_{\beta} \otimes_{k} B)$ dominates an irreducible component of $\operatorname{Spec}(A_{\alpha}
\otimes_{k} B)$ for $A_{\alpha} \subset A_{\beta}$, which follows at once from the fact that $B$ is a flat $k$-module,
from (2.3.7, (ii)) and from the fact that $A_{\alpha}$ and $A_{\beta}$ are integral rings.

**Proposition (6.14.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.4 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $A'$ a Noetherian $A$-algebra such that the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is normal. Let $B$ be an $A$-algebra, $C$ the integral closure of $A$ in $B$; set $B' = B
\otimes_{A} A'$, $C' = C \otimes_{A} A'$, $C'$ identifying with a sub-ring of $B'$; then $C'$ is the integral closure of
$A'$ in $B'$.*

We proceed in several steps.

**I)** *Reduction to the case where the ring $B$ is reduced.* — Set $B_{0} = B_{red} = B/\mathfrak{N}$, where
$\mathfrak{N}$ is the nilradical of $B$, and let $C_{0}$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $B_{0}$. One has the
following lemma:

**Lemma (6.14.4.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.4.1 -->

*Let $A$ be a ring, $B$ an $A$-algebra, $B_{0} = B/\mathfrak{n}$ the quotient of $B$ by a nil-ideal. If $C_{0}$ is the
integral closure of $A$ in $B_{0}$, the inverse image $C$ of $C_{0}$ by the canonical homomorphism $\phi : B \to B_{0}$
is the integral closure of $A$ in $B$.*

Indeed, if $x \in B$ is such that $\phi(x)$ satisfies an integral dependence equation with coefficients in $A$, one
deduces that $x$ satisfies a relation of the form $x^{n} + a_{1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n} = z$ with $a_{i} \in A$ and $z
\in \mathfrak{n}$, whence, by raising to a sufficiently large power, an integral dependence equation for $x$, with
coefficients in $A$.

One has therefore the exact sequence of $A$-modules

$$ 0 \to C \to B \to B_{0}/C_{0} $$

whence, by flatness, the exact sequence

$$ 0 \to C' \to B' \to B'_{0}/C'_{0} $$

where one has set $B'_{0} = B_{0} \otimes_{A} A'$, $C'_{0} = C_{0} \otimes_{A} A'$. If one proves that $C'_{0}$ is the
integral closure of $A'$ in $B'_{0}$, Lemma (6.14.4.1) will prove that $C'$ is the integral closure of $A'$ in $B'$.

**II)** *Reduction to the case where $B$ is an integral $A$-algebra of finite type containing $A$.* — Let $(B_{\alpha})$
be the increasing filtered family of sub-$A$-algebras of finite type of $B$, and let $C_{\alpha}$ be the integral
closure

<!-- original page 175 -->

of $A$ in $B_{\alpha}$. It follows at once from the definition of the integral closure that $C$ is the union of the
$C_{\alpha}$; if one sets $B'_{\alpha} = B_{\alpha} \otimes_{A} A'$, $C'_{\alpha} = C_{\alpha} \otimes_{A} A'$, then
$C'_{\alpha}$ is contained in $B'_{\alpha}$ by flatness, and for the same reason $B'$ is the union of the increasing
filtered family of the $B'_{\alpha}$ and $C'$ the union of the increasing filtered family of the $C'_{\alpha}$. If one
proves that $C'_{\alpha}$ is the integral closure of $A'$ in $B'_{\alpha}$, it will follow at once that $C'$ is the
integral closure of $A'$ in $B'$. One may therefore restrict to the case where $B$ is an $A$-algebra of finite type,
hence Noetherian; let $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) be its minimal prime ideals; as $B$ is supposed reduced, it
is identified with a sub-ring of the product $B_{0}$ of the $B/\mathfrak{q}_{i}$; if $C_{0}$ is the integral closure of
$A$ in $B_{0}$, one has $C = B \cap C_{0}$; if one sets $B'_{0} = B_{0} \otimes_{A} A'$, $C'_{0} = C_{0} \otimes_{A}
A'$, one has, by flatness, $C' = B' \cap C'_{0}$ $(0_{I}, 6.1.3)$; it therefore suffices to prove that $C'_{0}$ is the
integral closure of $A'$ in $B'_{0}$. But $C_{0}$ is the direct composition of the $C_{i}$, integral closures of $A$ in
$B_{i} = B/\mathfrak{q}_{i}$; consequently $C'_{0}$ is the direct composition of the $C'_{i} = C_{i} \otimes_{A} A'$ and
it suffices to show that $C'_{i}$ is the integral closure of $A'$ in $B'_{i} = B_{i} \otimes_{A} A'$. One is thus
reduced to the case where $B$ is integral and an $A$-algebra of finite type; if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the kernel of the
homomorphism $A \to B$, one has also $B' = B \otimes_{A/\mathfrak{p}}(A'/\mathfrak{p}A')$; as the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(A'/\mathfrak{p}A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A/\mathfrak{p})$ is normal, one may replace $A$ by
$A/\mathfrak{p}$ and $A'$ by $A'/\mathfrak{p}A'$, and consequently suppose that $A \subset B$.

**III)** *Case where $A$ is a field, $B$ a field, extension of finite type of $A$ and such that $A$ is algebraically
closed in $B$.* — One has then $C = A$, and $A'$ is a Noetherian geometrically normal $A$-algebra, hence direct
composition of integral and integrally closed rings $A'_{\lambda}$, the fraction fields $K'_{\lambda}$ of the
$A'_{\lambda}$ being separable extensions of $A$ (4.6.1). The $A'$-algebra $B'$ is therefore direct composition of the
$B \otimes_{A} A'_{\lambda} = B'_{\lambda}$, and one may therefore restrict to the case where $A'$ is integral, its
fraction field $K'$ being a separable extension of $A$. Now, as $B$ is a flat $A$-module, $B \otimes_{A} A' = B'$ is
identified with a sub-ring of $B \otimes_{A} K'$; as $K'$ is a separable extension of $A$, $B \otimes_{A} K'$ is reduced
(4.3.7), and as moreover $B$ is a primary extension of $A$, $B \otimes_{A} K'$ is integral (4.3.2); the same therefore
holds for $B'$. Let $L'$ be the fraction field of $B \otimes_{A} K'$ (which is also that of $B'$); it is evidently a
composite field $B(K')$ of its sub-fields $B$ and $K'$; as $A$ is algebraically closed in $B$, $K'$ is a separable
extension of $A$, and $B$ and $K'$ are linearly disjoint over $A$, $K'$ is algebraically closed in $B(K') = L'$
(Bourbaki, *Alg.*, chap. V, §9, exerc. 2); *a fortiori* $A'$, being integrally closed, is integrally closed in $L'$,
hence in $B'$, which proves the proposition in this case.

**IV)** *Case where $A$ is integral, $B$ a field, finite extension of the fraction field $K$ of $A$.* — Then $B' = A'
\otimes_{A} K \otimes_{K} B$ is a Noetherian geometrically normal $B$-algebra, and consequently $B'$ is direct
composition of integral rings; the total ring of fractions $L'$ of $B'$ is then direct composition of a finite number of
fields. This being so, as $B$ is the fraction field of $C$, $B'$ is a ring of fractions of $C'$ and $L'$ is therefore
also the total ring of fractions of $C'$. Now (6.14.1), since $C$ is a normal ring and $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ a normal morphism of Noetherian rings, $C'$ is a normal ring; but it follows from (6.14.1.1)
that $C'$ is then integrally closed in $L'$, and *a fortiori* in $B'$, and consequently is the integral closure of $A'$
in $B'$.

<!-- original page 176 -->

**V)** *End of the proof.* — According to II), one may suppose that $B$ is an integral $A$-algebra of finite type
containing $A$. Let $K$ be the fraction field of $A$, $L$ that of $B$, which is an extension of finite type of $K$. Let
$M$ be the algebraic closure of $K$ in $L$, which is a finite algebraic extension of $K$; let $C_{0}$ be the integral
closure of $A$ in $M$, which is also the integral closure of $A$ in $L$; one has therefore $C = B \cap C_{0}$; if one
sets $C'_{0} = C_{0} \otimes_{A} A'$, one has consequently $C' = B' \cap C'_{0}$ by flatness $(0_{I}, 6.1.3)$. Now, it
follows from IV) that $C'_{0}$ is the integral closure of $A'$ in $M' = M \otimes_{A} A'$; moreover, $M'$ is a
Noetherian ring and the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(M') \to \operatorname{Spec}(M)$ is normal (as one saw in IV));
applying III) to $M$ and $M'$ in place of $A$ and $A'$ and to $L$ in place of $B$, one deduces that $M'$ is integrally
closed in $L' = L \otimes_{A} A'$; hence $C'_{0}$ is the integral closure of $A'$ in $L'$, and $C' = C'_{0} \cap B'$ is
the integral closure of $A'$ in $B'$. Q.E.D.

**Corollary (6.14.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.14.5 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $A'$ a Noetherian $A$-algebra such that the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is normal. Let $B$, $C$ be two $A$-algebras, $\phi : B \to C$ an $A$-homomorphism making $C$
into a $B$-algebra, $D$ the integral closure of $B$ in $C$. If one sets $B' = B \otimes_{A} A'$, $C' = C \otimes_{A}
A'$, $D' = D \otimes_{A} A'$, then $D'$ is the integral closure of $B'$ in $C'$.*

Let $(B_{\lambda})$ be the increasing filtered family of sub-$A$-algebras of finite type of $B$, and set $B'_{\lambda} =
B_{\lambda} \otimes_{A} A'$, so that $B'$ is the union of the increasing filtered family of the sub-$A'$-algebras of
finite type $B'_{\lambda}$. Let $D_{\lambda}$ be the integral closure of $B_{\lambda}$ in $C$, and set $D'_{\lambda} =
D_{\lambda} \otimes_{A} A'$, so that $D$ is the union of the $D_{\lambda}$ and $D'$ the union of the $D'_{\lambda}$; if
we prove that $D'_{\lambda}$ is the integral closure of $B'_{\lambda}$ in $C'$, it will follow that $D'$ is the integral
closure of $B'$ in $C'$. Now $B_{\lambda}$ and $B'_{\lambda}$ are Noetherian and the morphism
$\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\lambda}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(B_{\lambda})$ is normal (6.8.2); one may therefore apply
(6.14.4) replacing $A$, $A'$ and $B$ by $B_{\lambda}$, $B'_{\lambda}$ and $C$ respectively, whence the corollary.

One may for example apply (6.14.5) when $A$ is an excellent local ring and $A'$ its completion $\hat{A}$, since in this
case $\operatorname{Spec}(A') \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is a regular morphism (7.8.2).

## 6.15. Geometrically unibranch preschemes

**(6.15.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.1 -->

We shall say that a prescheme $X$ is **unibranch** (resp. **geometrically unibranch**) at a point $x$, or that the point
$x$ is unibranch (resp. geometrically unibranch) in $X$, if the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{x}$ is unibranch (resp.
geometrically unibranch) (0, 23.2.1); we shall say that $X$ is unibranch (resp. geometrically unibranch) if it is so at
every point. It follows from this definition that, for $X$ to be unibranch (resp. geometrically unibranch) at a point,
it is necessary and sufficient that $X_{red}$ be so at this point.

**(6.15.2).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.2 -->

One must take care that, with the definitions of (6.15.1), a local ring $A$ may be unibranch (resp. geometrically
unibranch) without $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ being so; in other words, it may happen that there are prime ideals
$\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ such that $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is not unibranch; it amounts to the same to say that on a prescheme,
the notion of geometrically unibranch point is not stable under generization. We shall see this on the following
example.

<!-- original page 177 -->

Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, $B$ the integral ring $K[U, V, W]/(U^{2}(U - W) -
V^{2}(U + W))$ ($U$, $V$, $W$ indeterminates), so that $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ is a "cone with vertex at the
origin, having a double generator". We shall denote by $u$, $v$, $w$ the images of $U$, $V$, $W$ in $B$. Let $R$ be the
fraction field of $B$, and consider in $R$ the element $t = v(u + w)/u$, which does not belong to $B$; we show that $C =
B[t]$ is the integral closure of $B$. Indeed, one has $t^{2} = u^{2} - w^{2}$, hence $t$ is integral over $B$, and $v =
tu/(u + w)$; the ring $C_{1} = K[t, u, w]$ is integrally closed, for it is isomorphic to $K[T, U, W]/(T^{2} - U^{2} +
W^{2})$ and is therefore the integral closure of the integrally closed ring $K[U, W]$ in the quadratic extension $K(U,
W)(\sqrt{(U^{2} - W^{2})})$ of its fraction field (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §1, nÂ° 6, prop. 18). The ring of
fractions $K[t, u, w, 1/(u + w)]$ of $C_{1}$ is therefore also integrally closed. In the same way, one sees that the
ring $C_{2} = K[t, v, w]$ is integrally closed, for $t$ satisfies an integral dependence equation over $K[v, w]$ (an
explicit polynomial relation deducible from $t^{2} = u^{2} - w^{2}$ and $v = tu/(u + w)$ by eliminating $u$), and
consequently $K[t, v, w, 1/(t - v)] = K[t, v/(u + w), w, 1/(tw)]$ is integrally closed. Finally, taking into account
that $u$ and $w$ are algebraically independent over $K$, one easily proves that $C = K[t, u, v, w] = K[t, u, w, 1/(u +
w)] \cap K[t, v, w, 1/(t - v)]$, which completes the proof that $C$ is the integral closure of $B$. It is immediate that
if $\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ is the maximal ideal of $B$ generated by $u$, $v$, $w$ ("vertex of the cone"), there exists a
single maximal ideal $\mathfrak{n}_{0}$ of $C$ above $\mathfrak{m}_{0}$, namely the ideal generated by $t$, $u$, $v$,
$w$. If one sets $A = B_{\mathfrak{m}_{0}}$, one deduces easily that $A' = C_{\mathfrak{n}_{0}}$ is the integral closure
of $A$, which is therefore unibranch, and consequently also geometrically unibranch since its residue field $K$ is
algebraically closed. But in $A$ the prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ generated by $u$ and $v$ is such that the integral
closure $A_{\mathfrak{p}}[t]$ of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is not a local ring.

We shall see however further on (9.7.10) that when $X$ is a locally Noetherian prescheme such that, if $X'$ is the
normalization of $X_{red}$, the canonical morphism $X' \to X$ is finite (which will be the case if $X$ is such that the
rings of its affine open sets are universally Japanese (0, 23.1.1)), then the set of points $x \in X$ where $X$ is
geometrically unibranch is locally constructible.

**(6.15.3).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.3 -->

We shall say for short that a morphism $f : X \to Y$ is **radicial at a point** $y \in Y$ if $f^{-1}(y)$ is empty or
reduced to a single point $x$ and if $k(x)$ is a radicial extension of $k(y)$. It amounts to the same to say that $f$ is
radicial at all points of $Y$ or that $f$ is radicial (I, 3.5.8). If $g : f^{-1}(y) \to \operatorname{Spec}(k(y))$ is
the inverse image morphism of $f$ by the base change $\operatorname{Spec}(k(y)) \to Y$, it amounts to the same to say
that $f$ is radicial at the point $y \in Y$, or that $g$ is radicial.

**Lemma (6.15.3.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.3.1 -->

*(i) Let $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ be two morphisms. If $f$ is radicial at a point $y$ and $g$ radicial at the point
$z = g(y)$, then $g \circ f$ is radicial at the point $g(y)$. The converse is true if $f$ is surjective.*

*(ii) Let $f : X \to Y$, $h : Y' \to Y$ be two morphisms, and let $f' = f_{(Y')} : X \times_{Y} Y' \to Y'$. Let $y' \in
Y'$ and $y = h(y')$; then for $f$ to be radicial at the point $y$, it is necessary and sufficient that $f'$ be radicial
at the point $y'$.*

<!-- original page 178 -->

(i) If $f$ is radicial at the point $y$ and $g$ radicial at the point $z$, then $g^{-1}(z)$ is reduced to $y$ and
$f^{-1}(g^{-1}(z)) = f^{-1}(y)$ is empty or reduced to a single point $x$; moreover $k(x)$ is a radicial extension of
$k(y)$ and $k(y)$ a radicial extension of $k(z)$, hence $k(x)$ is a radicial extension of $k(z)$. Conversely, suppose
$f$ surjective; if $g \circ f$ is radicial at the point $z = g(y)$, then $g^{-1}(z)$ reduces to the single point $y$,
otherwise $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(z))$ would have at least two distinct points; moreover, $f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(z))$ reduces
to a single point $x$, and by hypothesis one has $k(z) \subset k(y) \subset k(x)$, and $k(x)$ is radicial over $k(z)$,
hence $k(y)$ is radicial over $k(z)$ and $k(x)$ radicial over $k(y)$.

(ii) Let $g : f^{-1}(y) \to \operatorname{Spec}(k(y))$, $g' : f'^{-1}(y') \to \operatorname{Spec}(k(y'))$ be the inverse
image morphisms of $f$ and $f'$ respectively; as $f'^{-1}(y') = f^{-1}(y) \otimes_{k(y)} k(y')$ (I, 3.6.4), $g'$ is the
inverse image of $g$, and the assertion reduces to (2.6.1, (v)).

Let then $X$ be a reduced prescheme having only a finite number of irreducible components, and let $X'$ be its
normalization (II, 6.3.8); one knows (*loc. cit.*) that the canonical morphism $f : X' \to X$ is surjective. The
definition (6.15.1) then shows that for $X$ to be geometrically unibranch at a point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient
that $f$ be radicial at this point; for $X$ to be geometrically unibranch, it is therefore necessary and sufficient that
$f$ be radicial.

**(6.15.4).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.4 -->

Generalizing the definition given in (I, 2.2.9), we shall say that, for two reduced preschemes $X$, $Y$, a morphism $f :
X \to Y$ is **birational** if the restriction of $f$ to the set of maximal points of $X$ is a bijection of this set onto
the set of maximal points of $Y$, and if, for every maximal point $y$ of $Y$, the morphism $X \times_{Y}
\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{y}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{y})$ deduced from $f$ is an isomorphism (in
other words, if the fibre $f^{-1}(y)$ reduces to a single point $x$ (maximal in $X$) and if the homomorphism $k(y) \to
k(x)$ deduced from $f$ is bijective); this notion reduces to that of (I, 2.2.9) when $X$ and $Y$ have only a finite
number of irreducible components.

**Lemma (6.15.4.1).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.4.1 -->

*Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism, $g : Y' \to Y$ a flat morphism, $X' = X \times_{Y} Y'$, $f' = f_{(Y')} : X' \to Y'$.
If $f$ is birational, the same holds for $f'$.*

Indeed, if $y'$ is a maximal point of $Y'$, one knows (2.3.4, (ii)) that $y = g(y')$ is a maximal point of $Y$; there
exists a single point $x$ of $X$ in $f^{-1}(y)$ by hypothesis; moreover $x$ is maximal in $X$ and such that $k(x) =
k(y)$. It follows therefore from (I, 3.4.9) that $f'^{-1}(y')$ reduces to a single point $x'$ and that $k(x') = k(y')$.
One concludes the reasoning by remarking that according to (2.3.7, (ii)), every irreducible component of $X'$ dominates
an irreducible component of $Y'$.

**Proposition (6.15.5).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.5 -->

*Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism such that $f_{red}$ is integral and birational (6.15.4), hence surjective.*

*(i) For $Y$ to be geometrically unibranch at a point $y$, it is necessary and sufficient that $f$ be radicial at the
point $y$ and that $X$ be geometrically unibranch at the unique point $x$ of $f^{-1}(y)$.*

*(ii) For $Y$ to be geometrically unibranch, it is necessary and sufficient that $X$ be geometrically unibranch and that
$f$ be radicial.*

One may evidently restrict to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are reduced; the fact that $f$ is surjective follows from the
fact that $f$ is a closed morphism (II, 6.1.10) and that $f(X)$ contains by hypothesis all maximal points of $Y$. This
shows at once that (i) entails (ii). Using (I, 3.6.5) and (II, 6.1.5), one may suppose, to prove (i), that $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{Y,y})$,

<!-- original page 179 -->

in other words $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is local. As $f$ is affine, one has also $X =
\operatorname{Spec}(B)$. If $A$ is geometrically unibranch, it is integral, hence the same holds for $B$ since $f$ is
birational; conversely, if $f$ is radicial at the point $y$ and $X$ geometrically unibranch at the point $x$, $B$ has
only a single maximal ideal (since it is integral over $A$ and every maximal ideal of $B$ is therefore above that of
$A$), in other words $B$ is a local ring, and to say that $X$ is geometrically unibranch at the point $x$ means that $B$
is geometrically unibranch, hence integral. As $f$ is dominant by hypothesis and $A$ is reduced, one concludes that $A
\subset B$ (I, 1.2.7); hence $A$ is also integral. Thus, to prove (i), one may restrict to the case where $A$ and $B$
are local, integral, $A$ being contained in $B$ and having the same fraction field, and consequently (since $B$ is
integral over $A$) the same integral closure $C$. But then the assertion follows from (6.15.3.1, (i)) applied to the
morphisms $\operatorname{Spec}(C) \to \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ and $\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$,
in view of the interpretation given in (6.15.3) of the property of being geometrically unibranch at a point.

**Proposition (6.15.6).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.6 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a $k$-prescheme. If $X$ is normal, then, for every extension $k'$ of $k$, $X' = X \otimes_{k}
k'$ is geometrically unibranch.*

One knows that $k'$ is an algebraic extension of a pure extension $k_{0}$ of $k$, and if $k''$ is the largest separable
extension of $k_{0}$ contained in $k'$, $k'$ is a radicial extension of $k''$ and $k''$ a separable extension of $k$.
One knows (6.14.2) that $X'' = X \otimes_{k} k''$ is normal; as $X \otimes_{k} k' = X'' \otimes_{k''} k'$, one sees that
one may restrict to the case where the extension $k'$ of $k$ is radicial. Moreover (I, 3.6.5), one may suppose that $X =
\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is an integrally closed integral local ring (since $X$ is normal). The projection
morphism $f : X' \to X$ is a homeomorphism, since $\operatorname{Spec}(k') \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$ is a universal
homeomorphism (2.4.5); as $X' = \operatorname{Spec}(A')$ where $A' = A \otimes_{k} k'$, one sees therefore that $A'$ is
a local ring whose nilradical $\mathfrak{N}'$ is the unique minimal prime ideal, whence $X'_{red} =
\operatorname{Spec}(A_{0})$, where $A_{0} = A'/\mathfrak{N}'$ is an integral local ring; moreover, if $K$ is the
fraction field of $A$, the fraction field $K_{0}$ of $A_{0}$ is radicial over $K$, since the morphism $f$ is radicial.
As $A_{0}$ is integral over $A$, its integral closure $B$ is also the integral closure of $A$ in $K_{0}$. But as $A$ is
integrally closed, one knows (Bourbaki, *Alg. comm.*, chap. V, §2, nÂ° 3, lemma 3) that $B$ is the set of $x \in
K_{0}$ of which some $p^{m}$-th power (for $m$ sufficiently large) belongs to $A$ ($p$ being the characteristic exponent
of $K$); moreover there exists only one prime ideal of $B$ above each prime ideal of $A$; in particular $B$ is a local
ring and its residue field is a radicial extension of that of $A$, and *a fortiori* of that of $A_{0}$, which proves
that $A_{0}$ is geometrically unibranch, and consequently the same holds for $X'$.

**Proposition (6.15.7).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.7 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a $k$-prescheme, $k'$ an extension of $k$, $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$. Let $x'$ be a point of
$X'$, $x$ its projection in $X$. For $X$ to be geometrically unibranch at the point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient
that $X'$ be geometrically unibranch at the point $x'$. For $X$ to be geometrically unibranch, it is necessary and
sufficient that $X'$ be so.*

The second assertion follows from the first and from the fact that the projection $f : X' \to X$ is a surjective
morphism. To prove the first assertion, one may, by virtue of (I, 5.1.8), restrict to the case where $X$ is reduced, and
by virtue of (I, 3.6.5), to the case

<!-- original page 180 -->

where $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ (with $A = \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$) is a local scheme. Note that $A' =
\mathcal{O}_{X',x'}$ is by hypothesis a faithfully flat $A$-module, hence containing $A$, and consequently the
hypothesis that $X$ is geometrically unibranch at the point $x$, or the hypothesis that $X'$ is geometrically unibranch
at the point $x'$, both entail that $A$ is an integral local ring (since $A$, being reduced, is also isomorphic to a
sub-ring of $A'$). Let $K$ be the fraction field of $A$, $B$ the integral closure of $A$, and set $Y =
\operatorname{Spec}(B)$; it amounts to the same to say that $X$ is geometrically unibranch at the point $x$ or that the
morphism $g : Y \to X$ is radicial at the point $x$ (6.15.3). Let $Y' = Y \otimes_{k} k' = Y \times_{X} X'$, so that one
has the commutative diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
Y & \longleftarrow & Y' \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
X & \xleftarrow{f} & X'
\end{array}
$$

Note that $f$ is a flat morphism; hence (6.15.4.1) the integral morphism $g'$ is birational. On the other hand, as $Y$
is normal, $Y'$ is geometrically unibranch (6.15.6). For $X'$ to be geometrically unibranch at $x'$, it is therefore
necessary and sufficient that $g'$ be radicial at the point $x'$ (6.15.5). Now, $x$ is the projection of $x'$ in $X$ and
it is equivalent to say that $g$ is radicial at the point $x$ or that $g'$ is radicial at the point $x'$ (6.15.3.1);
finally, for $X$ to be geometrically unibranch at the point $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that $g$ be radicial at
this point, whence the proposition.

**Lemma (6.15.8).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.8 -->

*Let $k$ be a separably closed field (in other words, such that the algebraic closure of $k$ is radicial over $k$), $X$
a $k$-prescheme locally of finite type over $k$, $x$ a closed point of $X$. If $X$ is unibranch at the point $x$, it is
geometrically unibranch at this point.*

Indeed, one knows (I, 6.4.2) that $k(x)$ is an algebraic extension of $k$; as the residue field of the integral closure
of $(\mathcal{O}_{x})_{red}$ (integral closure which is by hypothesis a local ring) is an algebraic extension of $k(x)$,
it is a radicial extension of $k$ by hypothesis, hence also of $k(x)$.

**Corollary (6.15.9).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.9 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a $k$-prescheme locally of finite type over $k$, $k'$ a separably closed extension of $k$ (in
other words, such that the algebraic closure of $k'$ is radicial over $k'$); then, for $X$ to be geometrically
unibranch, it is necessary and sufficient that $X' = X \otimes_{k} k'$ be unibranch.*

In view of (6.15.7), one is reduced to proving that if $X$ is unibranch and $k$ separably closed, then $X$ is
geometrically unibranch. Now, $X$ is geometrically unibranch at its closed points (6.15.8); we shall conclude in
(10.4.9) that $X$ is geometrically unibranch at all its points, by relying on the fact (signalled at the end of
(6.15.2)) that the set of points where $X$ is geometrically unibranch is constructible (of course, cor. (6.15.9) will
not be used until then).

This result justifies, to a certain extent, the terminology "geometrically unibranch".

<!-- original page 181 -->

**Proposition (6.15.10).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.10 -->

*Let $Y$, $Y'$ be two locally Noetherian preschemes, $g : Y' \to Y$ a normal morphism (6.8.1), $f : X \to Y$ a morphism;
set $X' = X \times_{Y} Y'$ and let $p : X' \to X$ be the canonical projection, $x'$ a point of $X'$. Then, if $X$ is
reduced (resp. geometrically unibranch, resp. integral and geometrically unibranch) at the point $x = p(x')$, $X'$ is
reduced (resp. geometrically unibranch, resp. integral and geometrically unibranch) at the point $x'$.*

By virtue of (I, 3.6.5), one may restrict to the case where $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $Y' =
\operatorname{Spec}(A')$, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$, where $A$, $A'$ and $B$ are local rings, the homomorphisms $A
\to A'$ and $A \to B$ being local, $A$, $A'$ Noetherian rings, and $x$ being the closed point of $X$; it is a question
of proving that if $B$ is reduced (resp. geometrically unibranch, resp. integral and geometrically unibranch) then $B' =
B \otimes_{A} A'$ is reduced (resp. $\operatorname{Spec}(B')$ is geometrically unibranch at the points of $p^{-1}(x)$,
resp. $\operatorname{Spec}(B')$ is integral and geometrically unibranch at these points). Suppose first only $B$
reduced; $B$ is the union of the increasing family of its sub-$A$-algebras of finite type $B_{\lambda}$, and by
flatness, $B'$ is the union of the increasing filtered family of its sub-$A'$-algebras $B'_{\lambda} = B_{\lambda}
\otimes_{A} A'$. Now, the morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(B'_{\lambda}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(B_{\lambda})$ is normal
(6.8.2), and *a fortiori* reduced; the fact that $B'_{\lambda}$ is reduced is therefore a consequence of (3.3.5); one
concludes that $B'$ itself is reduced by (5.13.2).

Suppose now $B$ geometrically unibranch; in view of (I, 5.1.8), one may moreover suppose $B$ reduced, hence integral.
Let $C$ be its integral closure, which is by hypothesis a local ring; set $Z = \operatorname{Spec}(C)$, $C' = C
\otimes_{A} A'$, $Z' = \operatorname{Spec}(C') = Z \times_{X} X'$, so that one has the commutative diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
Z & \longleftarrow & Z' \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
X & \xleftarrow{p} & X'
\end{array}
$$

By virtue of the first part of the reasoning, $X'$ is reduced; on the other hand, as $Z' = Z \times_{Y} Y'$, it follows
from (6.14.1) that $Z'$ is normal (and *a fortiori* geometrically unibranch). As $f$ is integral and birational, the
same holds for $f'$ by (6.15.4.1), since $p$ is flat. Finally, the hypothesis that $X$ is geometrically unibranch at the
point $x$ entails that $f$ is radicial at this point (6.15.5); one concludes therefore from (6.15.3.1) that $f'$ is
radicial at every point $x' \in p^{-1}(x)$, and it follows then from (6.15.5) that $X'$ is geometrically unibranch
(hence integral since it is reduced) at each of these points.

**Remarks (6.15.11).**

<!-- label: IV.6.15.11 -->

*(i) In the proof of (6.15.10), one cannot dispense with appealing to (6.14.1), even when $X = Y$, for one brings into
play the integral closure of the ring $B$, which is not necessarily a Noetherian ring even if $B$ is so.*

*(ii) The example (6.5.5, (ii)) shows that in (6.15.10), one cannot replace "geometrically unibranch" by "integral" in
the statement, even if the residue field $k(x)$ is algebraically closed and the morphism $g$ étale.*

<!-- original page 182 -->

One cannot either in this statement replace "geometrically unibranch" by "unibranch". Let $A$ be the complete integral
local ring $\mathbb{R}[[U, V]]/(U^{2} + V^{2})$; if $u$, $v$ are the images of $U$, $V$ in $A$, the maximal ideal of $A$
is $Au + Av$. One verifies easily that the integral closure of $A$ is the ring $A[t]$, where $t = u/v$ satisfies the
relation $t^{2} = -1$, so that $A[t]$ is isomorphic to the local ring $\mathbb{C}[[U]]$; as the residue field of
$\mathbb{C}[[U]]$ is $\mathbb{C}$, one sees that $A$ is unibranch but not geometrically unibranch. But $A
\otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is not an integral ring, being isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[[U, V]]/(U - iV)(U + iV)$.
