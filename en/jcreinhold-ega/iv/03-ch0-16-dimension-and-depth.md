# §16. Dimension and depth in Noetherian local rings

## 16.1. Dimension of a ring

**(16.1.1)** We call *dimension* (or *Krull dimension*) of a ring $A$, and denote $\dim(A)$, the (combinatorial)
dimension of its spectrum $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ `(14.2.1)`; since the irreducible closed subsets of
$\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ are the $V(\mathfrak{p})$, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal of $A$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §4, no 3, cor. 1 of prop. 14)`, it amounts to the same thing to say that $\dim(A)$ is
the supremum of the lengths of chains `(14.1.1)`

$$ \mathfrak{p}_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}_{n} $$

of prime ideals of $A$. If $A \neq 0$, one has $\dim(A) \geq 0$. An Artinian ring $\neq 0$ (in particular a field) is of
dimension $0$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §2, no 5, prop. 7)`; a Dedekind ring which is not a field (in particular
$\mathbb{Z}$ or a polynomial ring $k[T]$ in one indeterminate over a field $k$) is of dimension $1$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. VII, §2)`. A Noetherian ring is not necessarily of finite dimension `[30]`.

If $(\mathfrak{p}_{\alpha})$ is the family of minimal prime ideals of $A$, one has `(14.1.2.1)`

$$ \dim(A) = \sup_{\alpha} \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{\alpha}). \tag{16.1.1.1} $$

**(16.1.2)** For every ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of $A$, the prime ideals of $A/\mathfrak{a}$ correspond bijectively to the
prime ideals of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, hence

$$ \dim(A/\mathfrak{a}) \leq \dim(A). \tag{16.1.2.1} $$

If in addition $\mathfrak{a}$ is not contained in any minimal prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}_{\alpha}$ of $A$, every chain of
prime ideals of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$ can be completed by one of the $\mathfrak{p}_{\alpha}$, so one has

$$ 1 + \dim(A/\mathfrak{a}) \leq \dim(A). \tag{16.1.2.2} $$

<!-- original page 119 -->

**(16.1.3)** If $S$ is a multiplicative subset of $A$, the prime ideals of $S^{-1}A$ correspond bijectively to the prime
ideals of $A$ not meeting $S$, hence one has

$$ \dim(S^{-1}A) \leq \dim(A). \tag{16.1.3.1} $$

For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, one has, by definition `(14.2.1)`

$$ \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) = \operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{p}), \operatorname{Spec}(A)).
\tag{16.1.3.2} $$

This number is also called the *height* of the prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ and denoted $\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak{p})$.
More generally, for every ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of $A$, we call *height* of $\mathfrak{a}$ the number

$$ \operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak{a}) = \operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}),
\operatorname{Spec}(A)). \tag{16.1.3.3} $$

If $(\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda})$ is the family of prime ideals minimal among those that contain $\mathfrak{a}$, one has
therefore `(14.2.1)`

$$ \operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak{a}) = \inf_{\lambda}
\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak{p}_{\lambda}). \tag{16.1.3.4} $$

One has evidently

$$ \dim(A) = \sup_{\mathfrak{m}} \dim(A_{\mathfrak{m}}) \tag{16.1.3.5} $$

where $\mathfrak{m}$ ranges over the set of maximal ideals of $A$.

**(16.1.4)** For every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, one has `(14.2.2.2)`

$$ \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) + \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) \leq \dim(A). \tag{16.1.4.1} $$

We say that $A$ is *catenary* (resp. *equidimensional*, *equicodimensional*, *biequidimensional*) when
$\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is catenary (resp. equidimensional, equicodimensional, biequidimensional). When $A$ is
Noetherian and biequidimensional, the two sides of `(16.1.4.1)` are equal for every prime ideal of $A$ `(14.3.5)`.

For every ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of $A$, the prime ideals of $A/\mathfrak{a}$ correspond bijectively to the prime ideals
of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, so, if $A$ is catenary, so is $A/\mathfrak{a}$. Likewise, for every multiplicative
subset $S$ of $A$, the prime ideals of $S^{-1}A$ correspond bijectively to the prime ideals of $A$ not meeting $S$, so
if $A$ is catenary, so is $S^{-1}A$.

In addition, since the prime ideals of $A$ contained in a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ correspond bijectively to the prime
ideals of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, for $A$ to be catenary it is necessary and sufficient that $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ be so for
every $\mathfrak{p}$. To say that $A$ is catenary therefore means (`(14.3.2)` and `(16.1.3.2)`) that for every pair of
prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$, $\mathfrak{q}$ of $A$ such that $\mathfrak{q} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, one has

$$ \dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}}) + \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}} / \mathfrak{q} A_{\mathfrak{p}}) = \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}).
\tag{16.1.4.2} $$

If $A$ is biequidimensional, so is $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$.

**Proposition (16.1.5).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.1.5 -->

*Let $\rho : A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism making $B$ an $A$-algebra integral over $A$. Then one has $\dim(B) \leq
\dim(A)$; if in addition $\rho$ is injective, one has $\dim(B) = \dim(A)$.*

<!-- original page 120 -->

If $\mathfrak{n}$ is the kernel of $\rho$, $\rho(A)$ is isomorphic to $A/\mathfrak{n}$, so $\dim(\rho(A)) \leq \dim(A)$
by `(16.1.2.1)`, and since $B$ is integral over $\rho(A)$, one may restrict oneself to proving the second assertion when
$A \subset B$. If $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}_{n}$ is a chain of
prime ideals of $B$, the $\mathfrak{p}_{i} \cap A$ are then distinct prime ideals in $A$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. V, §2, no 1, cor. 1 of prop. 1)`, hence form a chain of prime ideals. Conversely, for
every chain $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}_{n}$ of prime ideals of $A$,
one knows that there exists for each $i$ a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}'_{i}$ of $B$ such that $\mathfrak{p}'_{i} \cap A =
\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ and that $\mathfrak{p}'_{i} \subset \mathfrak{p}'_{i+1}$ for $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$
`(loc. cit., cor. 2 of th. 1)`. Whence the conclusion.

**Proposition (16.1.6).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.1.6 -->

*Let $B$ be an integral ring, $A$ a local subring of $B$, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. Suppose that $A$ is
integrally closed and that $B$ is integral over $A$; then, for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $B$, one has
$\dim(B_{\mathfrak{n}}) = \dim(A)$.*

The first part of the reasoning of `(16.1.5)` shows that $\dim(B_{\mathfrak{n}}) \leq \dim(A)$. Conversely, consider a
chain of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}_{n} = \mathfrak{m}$
of $A$; one knows that $\mathfrak{n} \cap A = \mathfrak{m}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. V, §2, no 1, prop. 1)` and by
virtue of the hypotheses made, one may apply the second Cohen-Seidenberg theorem
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. V, §2, no 4, th. 3)`, which proves the existence of a chain of prime ideals
$\mathfrak{p}'_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}'_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}'_{n} = \mathfrak{n}$ of $B$ such that
$\mathfrak{p}'_{i} \cap A = \mathfrak{p}_{i}$ for every $i$; one deduces at once that $\dim(B_{\mathfrak{n}}) \geq
\dim(A)$, whence the proposition.

**(16.1.7)** Let $M$ be an $A$-module; we call *dimension* of $M$, and denote $\dim_{A}(M)$ or $\dim(M)$, the dimension
of the ring $A/\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ (isomorphic to the ring $A_{M}$ of homotheties of $M$). One has therefore
$\dim(M^{k}) = \dim(M)$ for every $k > 0$. If $M$ is of finite type, the prime ideals of $A$ containing
$\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ are exactly those belonging to $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.4)$ and the latter is
closed in $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, hence one has then

$$ \dim(M) = \dim(\operatorname{Supp}(M)) \leq \dim(A). \tag{16.1.7.1} $$

If $M$, $N$ are two $A$-modules such that $N \subset M$, one has

$$ \dim(N) \leq \dim(M), \qquad \dim(M/N) \leq \dim(M). \tag{16.1.7.2} $$

If $S$ is a multiplicative subset of $A$ and if $M$ is of finite type, one has

$$ \dim_{S^{-1}A}(S^{-1}M) \leq \dim_{A}(M). \tag{16.1.7.3} $$

Indeed, one has $\operatorname{Ann}(S^{-1}M) = S^{-1}(\operatorname{Ann}(M))$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §2, no 4)` and $S^{-1}A / S^{-1}(\operatorname{Ann}(M)) \cong S^{-1}(A /
\operatorname{Ann}(M))$.

On the other hand, every maximal chain of prime ideals containing $\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ ends at a maximal ideal
$\mathfrak{m}$, so its length is equal to that of the chain of corresponding prime ideals of $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ (which
contain $\operatorname{Ann}(M_{\mathfrak{m}}) = (\operatorname{Ann}(M))_{\mathfrak{m}}$); from this remark and from
`(16.1.7.3)`, one obtains

$$ \dim_{A}(M) = \sup_{\mathfrak{m}} \dim_{A_{\mathfrak{m}}}(M_{\mathfrak{m}}) \tag{16.1.7.4} $$

<!-- original page 121 -->

where $\mathfrak{m}$ ranges over the set of maximal ideals of $A$.

We say that $M$ is *catenary* (resp. *equidimensional*, *equicodimensional*, *biequidimensional*) when
$A/\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ is.

**Proposition (16.1.8).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.1.8 -->

*Let $A$ be a ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type, $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $A$. One has then*

$$ \dim_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) + \dim_{A}(M/\mathfrak{p}M) \leq \dim_{A}(M). \tag{16.1.8.1} $$

One has $\operatorname{Ann}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) = (\operatorname{Ann}(M))_{\mathfrak{p}}$, hence the prime ideals of
$A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ containing $\operatorname{Ann}(M_{\mathfrak{p}})$ correspond bijectively to the prime ideals of $A$
containing $\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ and contained in $\mathfrak{p}$. On the other hand, if $\operatorname{Ann}(M) =
\mathfrak{n}$, $V(\operatorname{Ann}(M/\mathfrak{p}M)) = V(\mathfrak{p} + \mathfrak{n})$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$, hence the
prime ideals of $A$ containing $\operatorname{Ann}(M/\mathfrak{p}M)$ contain $\mathfrak{p} + \mathfrak{n}$; whence the
conclusion.

This last remark shows in addition that one has

$$ \dim_{A/\mathfrak{p}}(M/\mathfrak{p}M) = \dim_{A}(M/\mathfrak{p}M). \tag{16.1.8.2} $$

**Proposition (16.1.9).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.1.9 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $\rho : A \to B$ a ring homomorphism, $M$ a $B$-module such that $M_{[\rho]}$ is an
$A$-module of finite type. Then one has*

$$ \dim_{A}(M_{[\rho]}) = \dim_{B}(M). \tag{16.1.9.1} $$

Indeed, the ring $B_{M}$ of homotheties of the $B$-module $M$ identifies with a subring of $C =
\operatorname{End}_{A}(M_{[\rho]})$, and $C$ is an $A$-module of finite type
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. III, §3, no 1, lemma 2)`, hence so is $B_{M}$; moreover the ring $A_{M}$ of homotheties of
the $A$-module $M_{[\rho]}$ is a subring of $B_{M}$, canonical image of $A$ in $C$, hence $B_{M}$ is finite over
$A_{M}$; the conclusion thus results from `(16.1.5)`.

**(16.1.10)** Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring; if $M$ is an $A$-module of finite length, one knows
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §2, no 5, prop. 7 and cor. 1 of prop. 7)` that $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ is a finite
discrete space, hence $\dim(M) = 0$ if $M \neq 0$; conversely, if $M$ is an $A$-module of finite type such that $\dim(M)
= 0$, every point of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ is closed, in other words is a maximal ideal of $A$, hence
`(loc. cit., prop. 7)` $M$ is of finite length.

## 16.2. Dimension of a Noetherian semi-local ring ¹

**(16.2.1)** Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $\mathfrak{r}$ its radical; recall that an *ideal of definition*
$\mathfrak{q}$ of $A$ is an ideal such that $\mathfrak{q} \subset \mathfrak{r}$ and that $\mathfrak{q}$ contains a power
of $\mathfrak{r}$; it amounts to the same thing to say that the only prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{q}$ are maximal,
or that $A/\mathfrak{q}$ is an Artinian ring. Let $M$ be an $A$-module of finite type; for every integer $n > 0$,
$M/\mathfrak{q}^{n} M$ is an $A$-module of finite length, equal to $\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}
\operatorname{long}(\operatorname{gr}_{i}(M))$, where $\operatorname{gr}_{\bullet}(M)$ is the graded
$(A/\mathfrak{q})$-module associated with $M$ endowed with the $\mathfrak{q}$-preadic filtration. One knows that there
exists a polynomial $Q(n)$ with rational coefficients such that $\operatorname{long}(\operatorname{gr}_{n}(M)) = Q(n)$
for $n$ large enough `(III, 2.5.4)`; one deduces at once from this that there exists *a polynomial $P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M,
n)$ in $n$, with rational coefficients, such that $\operatorname{long}(M/\mathfrak{q}^{n} M) = P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n)$
for $n$ large enough*; it is clear that this polynomial is unique and that its leading coefficient is $> 0$ if $M \neq
0$; one says that it is the *Hilbert-Samuel polynomial* of $M$ for the $\mathfrak{q}$-preadic filtration.

______________________________________________________________________

<!-- original page 122 -->

**Lemma (16.2.2.1).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.2.1 -->

*Let $(M_{n})$ be a $\mathfrak{q}$-good filtration of $M$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. III, §3, no 1)`; then
$\operatorname{long}(M/M_{n})$ is equal, for $n$ large, to a polynomial in $n$ whose degree and leading coefficient are
the same as those of $P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n)$.*

Indeed, there exists $n_{0}$ such that $M_{n+1} = \mathfrak{q} M_{n}$ for $n \geq n_{0}$, whence the inclusions
$\mathfrak{q}^{n+n_{0}} M \subset M_{n+n_{0}} = \mathfrak{q}^{n} M_{n_{0}} \subset \mathfrak{q}^{n} M \subset M_{n}$ for
$n$ large, which entails

$$ P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n + n_{0}) \geq \operatorname{long}(M/M_{n+n_{0}}) \geq P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n) \geq
\operatorname{long}(M/M_{n}) $$

and consequently the conclusion.

If $\mathfrak{q}'$ is a second ideal of definition, one has $\mathfrak{q}' \supset \mathfrak{q}^{m}$ for some integer
$m$, hence $P_{\mathfrak{q}'}(M, n) \leq P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, mn)$; consequently the degree of $P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n)$
does not depend on the ideal of definition $\mathfrak{q}$ considered; one denotes it $d(M)$.

**Lemma (16.2.2.2).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.2.2 -->

*Let $0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules of finite type. Then the polynomial
$P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n) - P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M', n) - P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M'', n)$ has degree $\leq d(M') - 1 \leq d(M) -
1$.*

Indeed, the filtration of the $M'_{n} = M' \cap \mathfrak{q}^{n} M$ is $\mathfrak{q}$-good
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. III, §3, no 1, prop. 1)`; since
$\operatorname{long}(M/\mathfrak{q}^{n} M) = \operatorname{long}(M''/\mathfrak{q}^{n} M'') + \operatorname{long}(M'/M'_{n})$,
the lemma follows at once from `(16.2.2.1)` applied to $M'$.

**Theorem (16.2.3) (Krull-Chevalley-Samuel).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.3 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $\mathfrak{r}$ its radical, $M \neq 0$ an $A$-module of finite type, $d(M)$
the degree of the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial of $M$ (for an arbitrary ideal of definition of $A$); let on the other hand
$s(M)$ be the infimum of the integers $n$ such that there exist elements $x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n}$ of $\mathfrak{r}$ for
which $M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)$ is of finite length. Then one has*

$$ d(M) = s(M) = \dim(M). $$

**Lemma (16.2.3.1).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.3.1 -->

*For every $x \in \mathfrak{r}$, let ${}_{x} M$ be the submodule of $M$ formed of the elements annihilated by $x$.
Then:*

*(i) One has $s(M) \leq s(M/_{x} M) + 1$.*

*(ii) Let $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ be the prime ideals belonging to $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ and such that*

$$ \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i}) = \dim(M) \qquad (1 \leq i \leq m). $$

*If $x \notin \mathfrak{p}_{i}$ for every $i$, one has $\dim(M/xM) \leq \dim(M) - 1$.*

*(iii) If $\mathfrak{q}$ is an ideal of definition of $A$, the polynomial*

$$ P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n) - P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M/xM, n) $$

*is of degree $\leq d(M) - 1$.*

Assertion (i) is trivial, since if $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is such that for the module $N = M/_{x} M$, $N/(x_{1} N +
\cdots + x_{r} N)$ is of finite length, it suffices to observe that this module is isomorphic to $M/(xM + x_{1} M +
\cdots + x_{r} M)$.

To prove (ii), one observes that, if $\mathfrak{a}$ is the annihilator of $M$, the prime ideals containing the
annihilator of $M/xM$ are those that contain $\mathfrak{a} + Ax$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$; none of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ can
therefore contain $\mathfrak{a} + Ax$, and by definition of $\dim(M)$ `(16.1.7)` every chain of prime ideals containing
$\mathfrak{a} + Ax$ therefore has length $\leq \dim(M) - 1$.

<!-- original page 123 -->

Finally, to prove (iii), one notes that one has two exact sequences

$$ 0 \to {}_{x} M \to M \xrightarrow{x} xM \to 0, \qquad 0 \to xM \to M \to M/xM \to 0 $$

and the assertion follows at once from lemma `(16.2.2.2)`.

The proof of `(16.2.3)` is done in three steps:

**(16.2.3.2)** *One has $\dim(M) \leq d(M)$.*

We reason by induction on $d(M)$, the case $d(M) = 0$ being trivial. Suppose then $d(M) \geq 1$, and let
$\mathfrak{p}_{0} \in \operatorname{Supp}(M)$ be such that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{0}) = \dim(M)$. This entails that
$\mathfrak{p}_{0}$ is a minimal element of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$, hence it is associated with $M$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 4, th. 2)` and $M$ consequently contains a submodule $N$ isomorphic to
$A/\mathfrak{p}_{0}$ `(loc. cit., §1, no 1)`; since $d(M) \geq d(N)$ by `(16.2.2.2)`, one is reduced to proving that
$\dim(N) \leq d(N)$. Let then $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \subset \cdots \subset \mathfrak{p}_{n}$ be a
chain of distinct prime ideals in $A$, and let us show that $n \leq d(N)$. This is evident if $n = 0$. Otherwise, there
exists $x \in \mathfrak{p}_{1} \cap \mathfrak{r}$ such that $x \notin \mathfrak{p}_{0}$, for the relation
$\mathfrak{p}_{0} \supset \mathfrak{p}_{1} \cap \mathfrak{r}$ would entail $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \supset \mathfrak{r}$ since
$\mathfrak{p}_{0}$ does not contain $\mathfrak{p}_{1}$, hence $\mathfrak{p}_{0}$ would be maximal, which is absurd. One
has $\mathfrak{p}_{i} \in \operatorname{Supp}(N/xN)$ for $i \geq 1$, hence $n - 1 \leq \dim(N/xN)$ `(16.1.7)`. Since
${}_{x} N = 0$ by virtue of the choice of $x$, one has $d(N/xN) \leq d(N) - 1$ by `(16.2.3.1, (iii))`. The induction
hypothesis then implies $d(N/xN) = \dim(N/xN) \geq n - 1$, hence $n - 1 \leq d(N) - 1$.

**(16.2.3.3)** *One has $d(M) \leq s(M)$.*

Let indeed $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ be a family of elements of $\mathfrak{r}$ such that, on setting $\mathfrak{a} =
x_{1} A + \cdots + x_{n} A$, $M/\mathfrak{a}M$ is of finite length. The ideals associated with $M/\mathfrak{a}M$ are
then maximal `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §2, no 5, prop. 7)` and since these are the only prime ideals containing
$\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{a} + (\mathfrak{r} \cap \operatorname{Ann}(M))$, $A/\mathfrak{q}$ is Artinian
`(loc. cit., prop. 9)` and $\mathfrak{q}$ is an ideal of definition of $A$. But one has $\mathfrak{q}^{m} M /
\mathfrak{q}^{m+1} M = \mathfrak{a}^{m} M / \mathfrak{a}^{m+1} M$, and if $M$ is generated by $r$ elements $y_{j}$,
$\mathfrak{a}^{m} M / \mathfrak{a}^{m+1} M$ is an $(A/\mathfrak{q})$-module generated by the canonical images of the
$x^{k_{1}}_{1} x^{k_{2}}_{2} \cdots x^{k_{n}}_{n} y_{j}$ where $\sum k_{i} = m$, hence by $r\cdot(\binom{m+n-1}{n-1})$
elements; its length is consequently $\leq \alpha\cdot\binom{m+n-1}{n-1}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant, and one deduces
at once that the degree of $P_{\mathfrak{q}}(M, n)$ is $\leq n$; whence $d(M) \leq s(M)$.

**(16.2.3.4)** *One has $s(M) \leq \dim(M)$.*

Let us first note that $n = \dim(M)$ is finite by `(16.2.3.2)`. We reason by induction on $n$; the proposition is
evident for $n = 0$, since $M$ is then of finite length `(16.1.10)`. Suppose $n \geq 1$, and let $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ ($1
\leq i \leq m$) be the prime ideals of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ such that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i}) = n$; the definition
of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ shows that they are minimal elements of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$, hence finite in number
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 4, th. 2)`. Since $n \geq 1$, the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ are not maximal, and there
exists therefore $x \in \mathfrak{r}$ such that $x \notin \mathfrak{p}_{i}$ for every $i$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`. By virtue of `(16.2.3.1)`, one has $s(M) \leq s(M/xM) + 1$ and
$\dim(M) \geq \dim(M/xM) + 1$; the induction hypothesis entails that $s(M/xM) \leq \dim(M/xM)$, whence the conclusion.

**Corollary (16.2.4).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.4 -->

*Under the hypotheses of `(16.2.3)`, one has*

$$ \dim_{A}(M) = \dim_{\hat{A}}(\hat{M}). \tag{16.2.4.1} $$

<!-- original page 124 -->

Indeed, $M/\mathfrak{r}^{n} M$ and $\hat{M}/\hat{\mathfrak{r}}^{n} \hat{M}$ are isomorphic, hence $d(M) = d(\hat{M})$.

**Corollary (16.2.5).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.5 -->

*The dimension of a Noetherian semi-local ring $A$ is finite and equal to the minimum number of elements of the radical
of $A$ generating an ideal of definition.*

This is the equality $s(M) = \dim(M)$ for $M = A$.

In particular:

**Corollary (16.2.6).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.6 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field; one has*

$$ \dim(A) \leq \operatorname{rg}_{k}(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^{2}). \tag{16.2.6.1} $$

Indeed, one knows that if the $x_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) are elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ whose classes mod
$\mathfrak{m}^{2}$ form a basis of the $k$-vector space $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^{2}$, the $x_{i}$ generate
$\mathfrak{m}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §3, no 2, cor. 2 of prop. 4)`.

**Proposition (16.2.7).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.2.7 -->

*Let $k$ be a field, $B$ a graded $k$-algebra of finite type with positive degrees generated by its homogeneous elements
of degree $1$ and such that $B_{0} = k$; let $E$ be a graded $B$-module of finite type, so that `(III, 2.5.4)`, for $n$
large enough, $\operatorname{rg}_{k}(E_{n}) = r(n)$ is of the form $\Phi(n) - \Phi(n - 1)$, where $\Phi$ is a polynomial
in $n$ of degree $d$. Then there exists in $B$ a family $(t_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq d}$ of $d$ homogeneous elements of
degrees $\geq 1$ such that $E/(\sum_{i} t_{i} E)$ is of finite rank over $k$.*

Let $\mathfrak{q}$ be the maximal ideal $\bigoplus_{n \geq 1} B_{n}$ of $B$, and, for every $n$, let $E^{n}$ be the
sub-$B$-module $\bigoplus_{h \geq n+1} E_{h}$ of $E$. Every element of $B - \mathfrak{q}$ determines an injective
homothety in the Artinian $B$-module $E/E^{n}$, and this homothety is therefore bijective
`(Bourbaki, Alg., chap. VIII, §2, no 2, lemma 3)`, which entails that $(E/E^{n})_{\mathfrak{q}}$ identifies with
$E/E^{n}$; since the residue field of $B_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is $k$, one deduces from the hypothesis that
$\operatorname{long}_{B_{\mathfrak{q}}}((E/E^{n})_{\mathfrak{q}})$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $d$. On the other
hand, since $E$ is a $B$-module of finite type and $B$ is generated by its homogeneous elements of degree $1$, the
filtration $(E^{n})$ on $E$ is $\mathfrak{q}$-good `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. III, §1, no 3, lemma 1)`, hence the
filtration $((E^{n})_{\mathfrak{q}})$ on $E_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is $\mathfrak{q} B_{\mathfrak{q}}$-good. Since
$B_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is a Noetherian local ring, one concludes from `(16.2.3)` and `(16.2.2.1)` that one has
$\dim(E_{\mathfrak{q}}) = d$. We then reason by induction on $d$, the lemma being evident if $d = 0$. Suppose $d \geq
1$, and observe that the minimal prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq r$) in $\operatorname{Ass}(E)$ are
graded `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §3, no 1, prop. 1)`, and that $\mathfrak{q}$ is distinct from the union of the
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ since $d \geq 1$; there is therefore a homogeneous element $t_{1} \in \mathfrak{q}$ not belonging to
any of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. III, §1, no 4, prop. 8)`. Since the prime ideals
$(\mathfrak{p}_{i})_{\mathfrak{q}}$ are the minimal elements of $\operatorname{Ass}(E_{\mathfrak{q}})$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 2, prop. 5)`, one has $\dim(E_{\mathfrak{q}} / t_{1} E_{\mathfrak{q}}) = d - 1$
`(16.3.4)`. It then suffices to apply the induction hypothesis to the graded $B$-module $E/t_{1} E$ to obtain the
conclusion.

## 16.3. Systems of parameters in a Noetherian local ring

**Proposition (16.3.1).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.1 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $A$, $n$ an integer. The following conditions are
equivalent:*

*a) $\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak{p}) = \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) \leq n$;*

*b) there exist $n$ elements $x_{i}$ of $A$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) such that $\mathfrak{p}$ is minimal in the set of prime
ideals containing the ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ generated by the $x_{i}$ (in other words $V(\mathfrak{p})$ is an irreducible
component of $V(\mathfrak{a})$).*

Condition b) entails that $\mathfrak{a} A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is an ideal of definition of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$, whence a) by
virtue of `(16.2.5)`. Conversely, if a) is satisfied, there exists an ideal of definition $\mathfrak{b}$ of
$A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ generated by $n$ elements $x_{i}/s$, with $s \in A - \mathfrak{p}$. By virtue of the bijective
correspondence between prime ideals of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and prime ideals of $A$ contained in $\mathfrak{p}$, the ideal
$\mathfrak{a}$ of $A$ generated by the $x_{i}$ satisfies b).

<!-- original page 125 -->

For $n = 1$, one obtains the particular case:

**Corollary (16.3.2) (Hauptidealsatz).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.2 -->

*For a prime ideal in a Noetherian ring to be of height $\leq 1$, it is necessary and sufficient that it be minimal in
the set of prime ideals containing a suitable principal ideal.*

**Corollary (16.3.3) (Artin-Tate).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.3 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian integral ring. The following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) $A$ is a semi-local ring of dimension $\leq 1$.*

*b) There exists $f \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $A_{f}$ is a field.*

Condition a) is equivalent to saying that $A$ has only a finite number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{m}_{i} \neq 0$, and
that these ideals are all maximal ($0$ being a prime ideal). Since the product of the $\mathfrak{m}_{i}$ is not zero, as
$A$ is integral, an element $f \neq 0$ of this product belongs to all the $\mathfrak{m}_{i}$, hence `(0)` is the only
prime ideal of the integral ring $A_{f}$, in other words $A_{f}$ is a field. (One notes that this part of the proof does
not use the fact that $A$ is Noetherian.) Let us now prove that b) entails a); the hypothesis b) means that every prime
ideal $\mathfrak{p} \neq 0$ of $A$ contains $f$. Let $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) be the prime ideals minimal
among those that contain $f$ (which are finite in number since $A/fA$ is Noetherian); it suffices to prove that the
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ are maximal ideals, for then every prime ideal $\neq 0$ necessarily contains one of the
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, hence is equal to it. Suppose then that there exists a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ containing one
of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ and distinct from the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$; $\mathfrak{m}$ is then not contained in the union of
the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`, in other words there exists $g \in
\mathfrak{m}$ not belonging to any of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$. Let $\mathfrak{q}$ be one of the prime ideals minimal
among those that contain $g$; it follows from the Hauptidealsatz `(16.3.2)` that $\mathfrak{q}$ is of height $1$, hence
$\neq 0$; consequently it contains $f$, hence also one of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, and since $g \in \mathfrak{q}$ and $g$
belongs to no $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$, $\mathfrak{q}$ is distinct from the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$; it would therefore be of
height $\geq 2$, which is contradictory.

**Proposition (16.3.4).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.4 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $\mathfrak{r}$ its radical, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type,
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ the elements of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ such that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i}) = \dim(M)$. Then the
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ are minimal elements of $\operatorname{Ass}(M)$, and one has $\dim(M/\mathfrak{p}_{i} M) = \dim(M)$.
For every $x \in \mathfrak{r}$, one has*

$$ \dim(M/xM) \geq \dim(M) - 1. \tag{16.3.4.1} $$

*In addition, for the two sides of `(16.3.4.1)` to be equal, it is necessary and sufficient that $x$ not belong to any
of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$.*

The first assertion is immediate, for the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ are by definition minimal elements of
$\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ `(16.1.6)`, and the latter are also minimal elements of $\operatorname{Ass}(M)$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 4, th. 2)`. In addition, $\operatorname{Supp}(M/\mathfrak{p}_{i} M)$ is the set
of prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$, hence
$\dim(M/\mathfrak{p}_{i} M) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i}) = \dim(M)$.

Set $N = M/xM$. If $y_{1}, \cdots, y_{r}$ are elements of $\mathfrak{r}$ such that $N/(y_{1} N + \cdots + y_{r} N)$ is
of finite length, this means that $M/(xM + y_{1} M + \cdots + y_{r} M)$ is of finite length, whence the inequality
`(16.3.4.1)` by virtue of `(16.2.3)`.

The fact that the two sides of `(16.3.4.1)` are equal when $x$ does not belong to any of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ results
from `(16.3.4.1)` and from `(16.2.3.1)`. Conversely, if

<!-- original page 126 -->

$\dim(M/xM) = \dim(M) - 1$, none of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ can belong to $\operatorname{Supp}(M/xM)$, and the prime
ideals of this support are those that contain $\operatorname{Ann}(M) + Ax$; since the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ contain
$\operatorname{Ann}(M)$, they cannot contain $x$.

**Corollary (16.3.5).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.5 -->

*With the notations of `(16.3.4)`, for every ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}_{i}$, one has
$\dim(M/\mathfrak{a}M) = \dim(M)$ and if one sets $N = M/\mathfrak{a}M$, the relation $\dim(M/xM) = \dim(M) - 1$ entails
$\dim(N/xN) = \dim(N) - 1$.*

Indeed, $\operatorname{Supp}(N)$ is the set of prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{a} + \operatorname{Ann}(M)$, hence
$\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ belongs to $\operatorname{Supp}(N)$ and since $\dim(N) \leq \dim(M) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i})$, one
has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i}) = \dim(N)$; in addition the prime ideals $\mathfrak{q} \in \operatorname{Supp}(N)$ such
that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{q}) = \dim(N)$ are some of the $\mathfrak{p}_{j}$; if $x$ does not belong to any of the
$\mathfrak{p}_{j}$, one has therefore $\dim(N/xN) = \dim(N) - 1$ by virtue of `(16.3.4)`.

**Definition (16.3.6).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.6 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $\mathfrak{r}$ its radical, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type, and set $n =
\dim(M)$. We call **system of parameters for $M$** any system $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ of $n$ elements of
$\mathfrak{r}$ such that $M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)$ is of finite length.*

It has been seen `(16.2.3)` that such systems always exist.

It has been seen in the course of the proof of `(16.2.3.3)` that if $\mathfrak{j} = \sum_{i} x_{i} A$ is such that
$M/\mathfrak{j}M$ is of finite length, $\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{j} + \operatorname{Ann}(M)$ is an ideal of definition
of $A$, and conversely, if this is so, $M/\mathfrak{q}^{n} M$ is a module of finite type over the Artinian ring
$A/\mathfrak{q}$, hence is of finite length. It therefore amounts to the same to say that $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is
a system of parameters for $M$ or for $A/\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ (or again that their images in $A/\operatorname{Ann}(M)$
form a system of parameters for this ring). If $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is a system of parameters for $M$, so is
$(x^{k}_{i})$ for every integer $k \geq 1$, since one may restrict oneself, by virtue of what precedes, to the case
where $M = A$, and if $\mathfrak{j}$ is an ideal of definition of $A$, the ideal $\sum^{n}_{i=1} x^{k}_{i} A$ contains
$\mathfrak{j}^{kn}$, hence is also an ideal of definition.

**Proposition (16.3.7).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.7 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $\mathfrak{r}$ its radical, $x_{1}, \cdots, x_{k}$ elements of $\mathfrak{r}$,
$M$ an $A$-module of finite type. One has then*

$$ \dim(M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{k} M)) \geq \dim(M) - k. \tag{16.3.7.1} $$

*In addition, for the two sides of `(16.3.7.1)` to be equal, it is necessary and sufficient that there exist elements
$x_{i}$ ($k + 1 \leq i \leq n = \dim(M)$) of $\mathfrak{r}$ such that $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is a system of
parameters for $M$.*

The inequality `(16.3.7.1)` results from `(16.3.4.1)` by induction on $k$. If the two sides of `(16.3.7.1)` are equal,
and if $x_{k+1}, \cdots, x_{n}$ is a system of parameters for $M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{k} M)$, it is clear that
$M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{k} M + x_{k+1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)$ is of finite length, hence $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$
is a system of parameters for $M$; conversely, if there exist $x_{i}$ ($k + 1 \leq i \leq n$) having this property and
if one sets $N = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{k} M)$, it is clear that $N/(x_{k+1} N + \cdots + x_{n} N)$ is of finite
length, hence $\dim(N) \leq n - k$, and the two sides are equal by virtue of `(16.3.7.1)`.

<!-- original page 127 -->

**Proposition (16.3.8).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.8 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian semi-local ring, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ its spectrum, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal of $A$
distinct from $A$ such that $\operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}), X) = r > 0$. There exist then $r$ elements
$x_{1}, \cdots, x_{r}$ of $\mathfrak{a}$, forming part of a system of parameters of $A$, such that*

$$ \operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}), V(A x_{1} + \cdots + A x_{r})) = 0. $$

Let $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$) be the minimal prime ideals of the ring $A$, $\mathfrak{q}_{j}$ ($1 \leq j
\leq n$) the prime ideals minimal among those that contain $\mathfrak{a}$; one has `(14.2.1)`
$\operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}), X) = \inf_{j} \operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{q}_{j}), X) = \inf_{j} \dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}})$ `(16.1.3.2)`. The hypothesis $r > 0$ entails that
$\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in none of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$; consequently there exists $x \in \mathfrak{a}$ not
belonging to any of the $\mathfrak{p}_{i}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`. One has as above
$\operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}), V(Ax)) = \inf_{j} \dim((A/Ax)_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}) = \inf_{j} \dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}/x A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}})$; but since $x/1$ is not contained in any
of the minimal prime ideals of $A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}$, one has $\dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}/x A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}) =
\dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}_{j}}) - 1$ `(16.3.4)`, whence $\operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}), V(Ax)) = r - 1$. For the same
reason, one has $\dim(A/Ax) = \dim(A) - 1$. We now reason by induction on $r$; if $r > 1$, there exist $r - 1$ elements
$x'_{i}$ ($2 \leq i \leq r$) of $A' = A/Ax$, forming part of a system of parameters of this ring, belonging to
$\mathfrak{a}/Ax$ and such that $\operatorname{codim}(V(\mathfrak{a}/Ax), V(A' x'_{2} + \cdots + A' x'_{r})) = 0$. Let
$(x'_{i})_{r+1 \leq i \leq s}$ be a system of elements of $A'$ such that $(x'_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq s}$ is a system of
parameters of $A'$; for every $i$ such that $2 \leq i \leq s$, let $x_{i}$ be an element of the class $x'_{i}$ in $A$,
with $x_{i} \in \mathfrak{a}$ for $2 \leq i \leq r$; it is immediate that $A/(Ax + Ax_{2} + \cdots + Ax_{s})$ is of
finite length, and since $\dim(A) = s$, one sees that $x_{1} = x$ and the $x_{i}$ of indices $i \geq 2$ answer the
conditions of the statement.

**Proposition (16.3.9).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.9 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of $A$, $k$ its residue field, $\phi : A
\to B$ a local homomorphism.*

*(i) One has*

$$ \dim(B) \leq \dim(A) + \dim(B \otimes_{A} k). \tag{16.3.9.1} $$

*(ii) Let $M \neq 0$ be an $A$-module of finite type, $N \neq 0$ a $B$-module of finite type. One has*

$$ \dim_{B}(M \otimes_{A} N) \leq \dim_{A}(M) + \dim_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k). \tag{16.3.9.2} $$

Let $m$ be the dimension of $A$, $(s_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ a system of parameters of $A$ `(16.3.6)`, so that if
$\mathfrak{a} = \sum_{i} s_{i} A$, $A/\mathfrak{a}$ is an $A$-module of finite length. Then the ring $A/\mathfrak{a}$ is
Artinian, so the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{a}$ of this ring is nilpotent; the ideal $\mathfrak{m} B /
\mathfrak{a} B$ of $B/\mathfrak{a}B$, image of $(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{a}) \otimes_{A} B$, is itself also nilpotent,
and consequently one has $\dim(B/\mathfrak{a}B) = \dim(B/\mathfrak{m}B)$ (the spectra of these two rings having the same
underlying space). On the other hand $B/\mathfrak{a}B = B/(s_{1} B + \cdots + s_{m} B)$, and the images of the $s_{i}$
in $B$ belong to the maximal ideal of $B$. Consequently `(16.3.7)`, one has

$$ \dim(B) \leq m + \dim(B \otimes_{A} k) $$

which is nothing other than `(16.3.9.1)`.

To prove `(16.3.9.2)`, note that if $\mathfrak{r}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{s}$) is the annihilator of $M$ (resp. $N$)

<!-- original page 128 -->

in $A$ (resp. $B$), one has $\dim_{A}(M) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{r})$, $\dim_{B}(N) = \dim(B/\mathfrak{s})$ by definition
`(16.1.7)`; on the other hand, $\operatorname{Supp}(M \otimes_{A} N)$ is a closed subset of
$\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ which identifies `(I, 9.1.13)` with
$\operatorname{Supp}(M) \times_{\operatorname{Spec}(A)} \operatorname{Supp}(N) = \operatorname{Spec}((B/\mathfrak{s}) \otimes_{A} (A/\mathfrak{r})) = \operatorname{Spec}(B/(\mathfrak{s} + \mathfrak{r}B))$. Since $N \otimes_{A} k$ is a $B$-module of
finite type, one has $\dim_{B \otimes_{A} k}(N \otimes_{A} k) = \dim_{B}(N \otimes_{A} k)$ `(16.1.9)`, and
$\operatorname{Supp}(N \otimes_{A} k)$ is equal to $\operatorname{Spec}(B/(\mathfrak{s} + \mathfrak{m}
B))$ by the same reasoning as above. Applying `(16.3.9.1)` to $A/\mathfrak{r}$ and to $B/(\mathfrak{s} + \mathfrak{r}B)$
one gets

$$ \dim(B/(\mathfrak{s} + \mathfrak{r}B)) \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{r}) + \dim(B/(\mathfrak{s} + \mathfrak{m} B)) $$

which is nothing other than `(16.3.9.2)`.

**Corollary (16.3.10).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.3.10 -->

*Under the hypotheses of `(16.3.9)`, if $\mathfrak{m} B$ is an ideal of definition of $B$, one has $\dim(B) \leq
\dim(A)$; if in addition $A$ is integral and $\dim(A) = \dim(B)$, $\phi$ is injective.*

The first assertion results from `(16.3.9)` since then $\dim(B/\mathfrak{m}B) = 0$. One may moreover replace $A$ by
$\phi(A)$, hence $\dim(B) \leq \dim(\phi(A))$; if $\mathfrak{a} = \operatorname{Ker}(\phi) \neq 0$, and if $A$ is
integral, one has $\dim(\phi(A)) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{a}) < \dim(A)$ `(16.1.2.2)`, hence one cannot then have
$\dim(A) = \dim(B)$ unless $\mathfrak{a} = 0$.

## 16.4. Depth and codepth ¹

**Proposition (16.4.1).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.1 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. Then every
$M$-regular sequence $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ `(15.1.7)` formed of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ forms part of a system
of parameters for $M$.*

We reason by induction on $r$; consider the $A$-module

$$ N = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r-1} M); $$

by hypothesis $x_{1}, \cdots, x_{r-1}$ form part of a system of parameters for $M$, hence $\dim(N) = \dim(M) - (r - 1)$
`(16.3.7)`. Since by hypothesis the homothety of ratio $x_{r}$ in $N$ is injective, $x_{r}$ does not belong to any of
the prime ideals associated with $N$, hence `(16.3.4)` one has $\dim(N/x_{r} N) = \dim(N) - 1$, which is also written

$$ \dim(M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)) = \dim(M) - r; $$

the conclusion follows therefore from `(16.3.7)`.

For an $A$-module $M \neq 0$, an $M$-regular sequence of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ has therefore at most $\dim(M)$
elements.

**Lemma (16.4.2).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.2 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field, $M$ an
$A$-module. For an $M$-regular sequence $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ to be maximal, it is
necessary and sufficient that one have $\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)) \neq
0$.*

To say that $(x_{i})$ is maximal means that, for no $x \in \mathfrak{m}$, the homothety of ratio $x$ in
$N = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)$ is injective, or again that $\mathfrak{m}$ is contained in the union of the prime
ideals associated with $N$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 1, cor. 2 of prop. 2)`, hence equal to one of these,
since it is a maximal ideal

general framework.

<!-- original page 129 -->

`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`; in other words, there is an element $z \in N$ whose annihilator
is $\mathfrak{m}$, and consequently the submodule $Az$ of $N$ is isomorphic to $A/\mathfrak{m} = k$, whence the lemma.

**Lemma (16.4.3).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.3 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field, $M$ an
$A$-module, $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ an $M$-regular sequence of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$. Then the $A$-modules
$\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M))$ and $\operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{A}(k, M)$ are isomorphic, and
for $n \geq 1$, they are also isomorphic to $\operatorname{Ext}^{n-1}_{A}(k, M/x_{1} M)$.*

We reason by induction on $n$, the proposition being evident for $n = 0$. Set $N = M/x_{1} M$; the sequence $(x_{i})_{2
\leq i \leq n}$ is $N$-regular, hence

$$ \operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n} M)) = \operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, N/(x_{2} N + \cdots + x_{n} N)) $$

is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Ext}^{n-1}_{A}(k, N)$ by virtue of the induction hypothesis. Consider then the exact
sequence $0 \to M --x_{1}\to M \to M/x_{1} M = N \to 0$; from it one deduces the exact sequence of $\operatorname{Ext}$s

$$ \operatorname{Ext}_{A}^{n-1}(k, M) \to \operatorname{Ext}_{A}^{n-1}(k, N) \to \operatorname{Ext}_{A}^{n}(k, M) \xrightarrow{x_{1}} \operatorname{Ext}_{A}^{n}(k, M). \tag{16.4.3.1} $$

By virtue of the induction hypothesis, $\operatorname{Ext}^{n-1}_{A}(k, M)$ is isomorphic to

$$ \operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{n-1} M)), $$

which is zero, since $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n-1}$ is not a maximal $M$-regular sequence `(16.4.2)`. On the other hand,
since $x_{1} \in \mathfrak{m}$, the homothety of ratio $x_{1}$ in the $A$-module $\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k, T)$ is zero
for every $A$-module $T$, hence so is the homothety of ratio $x_{1}$ in every $A$-module
$\operatorname{Ext}^{i}_{A}(k, T)$; the assertions of the lemma then follow at once from the exact sequence
`(16.4.3.1)`.

**Corollary (16.4.4).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.4 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ its residue field, $M$ an
$A$-module of finite type $\neq 0$. All maximal $M$-regular sequences of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ have the same number
of elements, which is the smallest integer $n$ such that $\operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{A}(k, M) \neq 0$.*

**Definition (16.4.5).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.5 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. We call
**depth** of $M$, and denote $\operatorname{prof}_{\mathfrak{m}}(M)$ or $\operatorname{prof}(M)$, the supremum of the
number of elements of an $M$-regular sequence formed of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$.*

One has therefore $\operatorname{prof}(M) = +\infty$ if and only if $M = 0$, and, by `(16.4.1)`

$$ \operatorname{prof}(M) \leq \dim(M) \qquad \text{if } M \neq 0. \tag{16.4.5.1} $$

One has evidently $\operatorname{prof}(M^{k}) = \operatorname{prof}(M)$ for every $k > 0$.

**Proposition (16.4.6).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.6 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type.*

*(i) For $\operatorname{prof}(M) = 0$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\mathfrak{m} \in \operatorname{Ass}(M)$ (or
again that there exist a submodule of $M$ isomorphic to the residue field $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$).*

*(ii) For every $M$-regular element $x$ belonging to $\mathfrak{m}$, one has*

$$ \operatorname{prof}(M/xM) = \operatorname{prof}(M) - 1. \tag{16.4.6.1} $$

*(iii) If $M \neq 0$, one has*

$$ \operatorname{prof}(M) \leq \inf_{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Ass}(M)} \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) \leq \dim(M). \tag{16.4.6.2} $$

<!-- original page 130 -->

*(iv) One has $\operatorname{prof}_{A}(M) = \operatorname{prof}_{\hat{A}}(\hat{M})$.*

(i) To say that $\operatorname{prof}(M) = 0$ means that there exists no $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ such that the homothety of
ratio $x$ in $M$ is injective, in other words that every $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ belongs to a prime ideal associated with
$M$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 1, cor. 2 of prop. 2)`; but $\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be the union of the prime
ideals associated with $M$ unless it is equal to one of them `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`.

(ii) If $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is an $(M/xM)$-regular sequence formed of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$, the sequence
formed of $x$ and the $x_{i}$ is $M$-regular, and it follows from the definition that it is maximal when the sequence
$(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is a maximal $(M/xM)$-regular sequence; whence the conclusion.

(iii) We reason by induction on $n = \operatorname{prof}(M)$, the assertion being evident for $n = 0$. We shall use the
following lemma:

**Lemma (16.4.6.3).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.6.3 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type, $t \in A$ an $M$-regular element. Then, for every
$\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Ass}(M)$, every prime ideal minimal among those containing $\mathfrak{p} + At$ is
associated with $M/tM$.*

One knows that there exists an exact sequence

$$ 0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0 $$

such that $\operatorname{Ass}(M') = {\mathfrak{p}}$, $\operatorname{Ass}(M'') = \operatorname{Ass}(M) - {\mathfrak{p}}$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 1, prop. 4)`; since $t$ is $M$-regular, it is also $M'$-regular and
$M''$-regular `(loc. cit., §1, no 1, cor. 2 of prop. 2)`. One deduces that the sequence

$$ 0 \to M'/tM' \to M/tM \to M''/tM'' \to 0 $$

is exact `(15.1.18)`. Consequently, one has $\operatorname{Ass}(M'/tM') \subset \operatorname{Ass}(M/tM)$. But the prime
ideals of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{p}$ are the points of $\operatorname{Supp}(M')$ `(loc. cit., §1, no 3, prop. 7)`,
hence the prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{p} + At$ are the points of the support of $M'/tM' = M' \otimes_{A} (A/tA)$
$(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$; a minimal element of the set of these prime ideals therefore belongs to $\operatorname{Ass}(M'/tM')$
`(Bourbaki, loc. cit., §1, no 3, cor. 1 of prop. 7)`, and a fortiori to $\operatorname{Ass}(M/tM)$.

This lemma being established, we return to the proof of (iii). Let $x \in \mathfrak{m}$ be an $M$-regular element, so
that $\operatorname{prof}(M/xM) = n - 1$ by (ii); for every $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Ass}(M)$, it follows from
the lemma that there is an ideal $\mathfrak{p}'$ associated with $M/xM$ and containing $\mathfrak{p} + Ax$; but as $x$
is $M$-regular, one has $x \notin \mathfrak{p}$, whence $\mathfrak{p}' \neq \mathfrak{p}$ and consequently
$\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}') \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) - 1$. Now the induction hypothesis shows that $n - 1 \leq
\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}')$; one concludes that $n \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{p})$ for every $\mathfrak{p} \in
\operatorname{Ass}(M)$.

(iv) One may restrict oneself to the case where $M \neq 0$. Recall that $\hat{M} = M \otimes_{A} \hat{A}$ up to a
canonical isomorphism $(0_{I}, 7.3.3)$; since $\hat{A}$ is a flat $A$-module, one has canonical isomorphisms
$\operatorname{Ext}^{i}_{A}(k, M) \otimes_{A} \hat{A} \cong \operatorname{Ext}^{i}_{\hat{A}}(k, M \otimes_{A} \hat{A})$
since $k = k \otimes_{A} \hat{A}$ up to a canonical isomorphism $(0_{III}, 12.3.5)$. Assertion (iv) thus results from
`(16.4.4)` and from the fact that $\hat{A}$ is a faithfully flat $A$-module $(0_{I}, 7.3.5)$.

**(16.4.6.4)** One notes that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal of $A$, one may have either
$\operatorname{prof}_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) < \operatorname{prof}_{A}(M)$ or
$\operatorname{prof}_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) > \operatorname{prof}_{A}(M)$; for an example of the first
case,

<!-- original page 131 -->

it suffices to take for $A$ a Noetherian local integral ring of dimension $\geq 1$; one has $\operatorname{prof}(A) \geq
1$ but $\operatorname{prof}(K) = 0$ for the field of fractions $K$ of $A$. For an example of the second case, consider a
Noetherian local integral ring $A_{0}$ of dimension $\geq 2$, with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ and let $k =
A_{0}/\mathfrak{m}_{0}$ be its residue field; let $A = A_{0} \oplus \mathfrak{j}$ be the trivial extension of $A_{0}$ by
the $A_{0}$-module $k$ `(18.2.3)`, the ideal $\mathfrak{j}$ being $A_{0}$-isomorphic to $k$ (so that multiplication in $A$
is given by $(x, \xi)(x', \xi') = (xx', x\xi' + x'\xi)$). It is clear that $\mathfrak{j}$ is the nilradical of $A$ and
$A/\mathfrak{j}$ is isomorphic to $A_{0}$, so that every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ is of the form
$\mathfrak{p}_{0} \oplus \mathfrak{j}$, where $\mathfrak{p}_{0}$ is a prime ideal of $A_{0}$; in particular $\mathfrak{m}
= \mathfrak{m}_{0} \oplus \mathfrak{j}$ is the unique maximal ideal of $A$. As every element of $\mathfrak{m}_{0}$
annihilates $\mathfrak{j}$, one has $\operatorname{prof}(A) = \operatorname{prof}(A_{\mathfrak{m}}) = 0$; on the other
hand, if $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \neq \mathfrak{m}_{0}$, the elements of $\mathfrak{j}$ are annihilated by those of
$\mathfrak{m}_{0} - \mathfrak{p}_{0}$, hence $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is canonically isomorphic to
$(A_{0})_{\mathfrak{p}_{0}}$, and as $A_{0}$ is integral, $\operatorname{prof}(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) =
\operatorname{prof}((A_{0})_{\mathfrak{p}_{0}}) \geq 1$ if $\mathfrak{p}_{0} \neq 0$.

**Corollary (16.4.7).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.7 -->

*For a Noetherian reduced local ring $A$ to be of depth $0$, it is necessary and sufficient that $A$ be a field.*

Indeed, since the intersection of the minimal prime ideals of $A$ is $0$, $A$ has no embedded associated prime ideals;
by virtue of `(16.4.6, (i))`, if $\operatorname{prof}(A) = 0$, the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$ is also a minimal
prime ideal, hence is the only prime ideal of $A$, and since $A$ is reduced, $\mathfrak{m} = 0$.

**Proposition (16.4.8).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.8 -->

*Let $A$, $B$ be two Noetherian local rings, $\rho : A \to B$ a local homomorphism, $M$ a $B$-module such that
$M_{[\rho]}$ is an $A$-module of finite type. Then one has*

$$ \operatorname{prof}_{A}(M_{[\rho]}) = \operatorname{prof}_{B}(M). \tag{16.4.8.1} $$

One may restrict oneself to the case $M \neq 0$; suppose that $\operatorname{prof}_{A}(M_{[\rho]}) = n$. If $(x_{i})_{1
\leq i \leq n}$ is a maximal $(M_{[\rho]})$-regular sequence formed of elements of the maximal ideal of $A$, the
$\rho(x_{i})$ constitute an $M$-regular sequence formed of elements of the maximal ideal of $B$, and one has therefore,
on setting $N = M/(\rho(x_{1}) M + \cdots + \rho(x_{n}) M)$, $\operatorname{prof}_{B}(N) = \operatorname{prof}_{B}(M) -
n$ `(16.4.6, (ii))`; similarly $N_{[\rho]} = M_{[\rho]}/(x_{1} M_{[\rho]} + \cdots + x_{n} M_{[\rho]})$ and
$\operatorname{prof}_{A}(N_{[\rho]}) = 0$; one is thus reduced to proving the proposition when $n = 0$. Let $k$ be the
residue field of $A$; since $k$ is a quotient of $A$, the $A$-module $P = \operatorname{Hom}_{A}(k,
M_{[\rho]})$ is a submodule of $\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(A, M_{[\rho]}) = M_{[\rho]}$ and the hypothesis
entails that $P \neq 0$ `(16.4.6, (i))`; in addition, $P$ is an $A$-module of finite type (since $M_{[\rho]}$ is an
$A$-module of finite type), hence a $k$-vector space of finite type, being annihilated by the maximal ideal of $A$, and
finally an $A$-module of finite length. On the other hand, $P$ is also a submodule of the $B$-module $M$, and since it
is of finite length as an $A$-module, it is a fortiori so as a $B$-module. Since it is $\neq 0$, it contains a simple
sub-$B$-module, that is to say isomorphic to the residue field of $B$; one concludes then from `(16.4.6, (i))` that one
has indeed $\operatorname{prof}_{B}(M) = 0$.

**Definition (16.4.9).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.9 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. If $M \neq 0$, we call **codepth** of $M$ and

\operatorname{prof}_{A}(M) \geq 0$ `(16.4.5.1)`. If $M = 0$, we set $\operatorname{coprof}(M) = 0$.*

One has $\operatorname{coprof}(M^{k}) = \operatorname{coprof}(M)$ for every $k > 0$.

**Proposition (16.4.10).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.10 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type.*

<!-- original page 132 -->

*(i) For every $M$-regular element $x$ belonging to the maximal ideal of $A$, one has $\operatorname{coprof}(M/xM) =
\operatorname{coprof}(M)$.*

*(ii) One has $\operatorname{coprof}_{A}(M) = \operatorname{coprof}_{\hat{A}}(\hat{M})$.*

Indeed, (i) results from `(16.3.4)` and `(16.4.6, (ii))`, and (ii) from `(16.2.4)` and `(16.4.6, (iv))`.

We shall show later `(IV, 6.11.5)` that for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, one has
$\operatorname{coprof}_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) \leq \operatorname{coprof}_{A}(M)$.

**Proposition (16.4.11).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.4.11 -->

*Under the hypotheses of `(16.4.8)`, one has*

$$ \operatorname{coprof}_{A}(M_{[\rho]}) \geq \operatorname{coprof}_{B}(M). \tag{16.4.11.1} $$

This results from `(16.1.9)` and `(16.4.8)`.

## 16.5. Cohen-Macaulay modules

**Definition (16.5.1).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.1 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring. We say that an $A$-module of finite type $M$ is a **Cohen-Macaulay module** if
$\operatorname{coprof}(M) = 0$, in other words if $M = 0$ or if $M \neq 0$ and $\dim(M) = \operatorname{prof}(M)$. We
say that $A$ is a **Cohen-Macaulay ring** if the $A$-module $A$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module.*

An $A$-module of finite length is a Cohen-Macaulay module since it is of dimension $0$ `(16.1.10)`. A reduced local ring
$A$ of dimension $1$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring, for then its maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be associated with $A$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §2, no 5, prop. 10)`, hence $\operatorname{prof}(A) = 1$ by virtue of `(16.4.6, (i))`.
If $A$ is an integrally closed integral local ring of dimension $\geq 2$, one has $\operatorname{prof}(A) \geq 2$:
indeed, if $x \neq 0$ is an element of $\mathfrak{m}$, one knows `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. VII, §1, no 4, prop. 8)`
that the prime ideals associated with $A/xA$ are of height $1$, hence distinct from $\mathfrak{m}$, and their union is
consequently distinct from $\mathfrak{m}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`; there exist therefore
sequences $(x, y)$ which are $A$-regular and formed of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$, whence our assertion. One concludes
that *an integrally closed local ring of dimension $2$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring*.

**Proposition (16.5.2).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.2 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. For $M$ to be a Cohen-Macaulay module, it is
necessary and sufficient that $\hat{M}$ be an $\hat{A}$-module of Cohen-Macaulay.*

This results at once from `(16.4.10, (ii))`.

**Proposition (16.5.3).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.3 -->

*Under the hypotheses of `(16.4.8)`, for $M$ to be a $B$-module of Cohen-Macaulay, it is necessary and sufficient that
$M_{[\rho]}$ be an $A$-module of Cohen-Macaulay.*

This results from `(16.4.11)`.

**Proposition (16.5.4).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.4 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type $\neq 0$. If $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module,
one has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) = \dim(M)$ for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Ass}(M)$; in particular
no prime ideal associated with $M$ is embedded.*

This results at once from the inequalities `(16.4.6.2)`.

One can also say that $M$ (or $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$) is equidimensional `(16.1.7)`.

<!-- original page 133 -->

**Proposition (16.5.5).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.5 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type $\neq 0$, $x$ an
element of $\mathfrak{m}$. Suppose that $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module; then the following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) $x$ is $M$-regular;*

*b) $\dim(M/xM) = \dim(M) - 1$;*

*c) $x$ belongs to no minimal element of $\operatorname{Supp}(M)$.*

*In addition, $M/xM$ is then a Cohen-Macaulay module.*

It has been seen `(16.5.4)` that all elements $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\operatorname{Ass}(M)$ are minimal in
$\operatorname{Supp}(M)$ and that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) = \dim(M)$; the equivalence of a) and c) results then from
`Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 1, cor. 2 of prop. 2`; the equivalence of b) and c) results from `(16.3.4)`. The
fact that $M/xM$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module results finally from `(16.4.10, (i))`.

**Corollary (16.5.6).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.6 -->

*Under the hypotheses of `(16.5.5)`, let $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ be a sequence of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$. The
following conditions are equivalent:*

*a) The sequence $(x_{i})$ is $M$-regular.*

*b) One has $\dim(M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)) = \dim(M) - r$.*

*c) The $x_{i}$ form part of a system of parameters of $M$.*

*In addition, when these conditions are satisfied, $N = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module,
hence, for every ideal $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Ass}(N)$, one has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) = \dim(M) - r$.*

One already knows that b) and c) are equivalent `(16.3.6)` and that a) entails c) `(16.4.1)` without hypothesis on $M$.
To see that c) implies a) and prove the last assertion of the statement, we reason by induction on $r$, the assertion
being trivial for $r = 0$. Since $x_{1}$ forms part of a system of parameters, $\dim(M/x_{1} M) = \dim(M) - 1$
`(16.3.6)`, hence $x_{1}$ is $M$-regular and $M/x_{1} M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module by `(16.5.5)`. Since the sequence
$(x_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq r}$ forms part of a system of parameters for $P = M/x_{1} M$, the induction hypothesis shows
that $(x_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq r}$ is a $P$-regular sequence and that $P/(x_{2} P + \cdots + x_{r} P) = N$ is a
Cohen-Macaulay module; in addition $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is $M$-regular.

**Remark (16.5.7).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.7 -->

*It follows from `(16.5.6)` that there is identity between the systems of parameters for $M$ and the maximal $M$-regular
sequences of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ when $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module. Conversely, it follows from `(16.4.1)` that
if a non-zero $A$-module $M$ of finite type is such that there is an $M$-regular sequence which is a system of
parameters for $M$, then $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module. The last property stated in `(16.5.6)` also characterizes
Cohen-Macaulay modules:*

**Proposition (16.5.8).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.8 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. Suppose that for every sequence $(x_{i})_{1 \leq
i \leq r}$ of elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ forming part of a system of parameters for $M$, and every prime ideal
$\mathfrak{p}$ associated with $N = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)$, one has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) = \dim(N)$. Then $M$
is a Cohen-Macaulay module.*

Let $(y_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ be a system of parameters for $M$; it suffices to show that the sequence $(y_{i})$ is
$M$-regular. We reason by induction on $n = \dim(M)$, the proposition being trivial for $n = 0$. By hypothesis (applied
with $r = 0$) the prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_{j}$ associated with $M$ are all such that $\dim(A/\mathfrak{p}_{j}) =
\dim(M)$; since $y_{1}$ forms part of a system of parameters

<!-- original page 134 -->

for $M$, it follows from `(16.3.7)` and `(16.3.4)` that $y_{1}$ does not belong to any of the $\mathfrak{p}_{j}$, hence
is $M$-regular. If one sets $P = M/y_{1} M$, $(y_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq n}$ is a system of parameters for $P$, and it is
immediate that $P$ satisfies the hypothesis of the statement; applying the induction hypothesis, one therefore sees that
$(y_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq n}$ is a $P$-regular sequence, which proves the proposition.

**Proposition (16.5.9).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.9 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type; suppose that $M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module. Let
$\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Supp}(M)$, and set $r = \dim(M) - \dim(M/\mathfrak{p}M)$. Then there exists an
$M$-regular sequence $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ formed of elements of $\mathfrak{p}$; for every sequence having these
properties, one has*

$$ \dim(M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)) = \dim(M/\mathfrak{p}M) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}), $$

*and $\mathfrak{p}$ is a minimal element of $\operatorname{Ass}(M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M))$.*

Let us first prove the existence of the $x_{i}$; there is nothing to prove for $r = 0$. For $r > 0$, we proceed by
induction on $r$. Since for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ associated with $M$ one has $\dim(A/\mathfrak{q}_{i}) =
\dim(M)$ `(16.5.4)`, the hypothesis $\dim(M/\mathfrak{p}M) < \dim(M)$ entails that $\mathfrak{p}$ cannot be contained in
any of the $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$, the latter being the prime ideals minimal among those that contain
$\operatorname{Ann}(M)$ (`(16.1.2.2)` and `(16.1.7)`); one concludes that $\mathfrak{p}$ is also not contained in the
union of the $\mathfrak{q}_{i}$ `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. II, §1, no 1, prop. 2)`, and consequently there exists
$x_{1} \in \mathfrak{p}$ which is $M$-regular `(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 1, cor. 2 of prop. 2)`. One thus
deduces from `(16.5.5)` that $N = M/x_{1} M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module, of dimension $\dim(M) - 1$; since $x_{1} \in
\mathfrak{p}$, one has moreover $N/\mathfrak{p}N = M/\mathfrak{p}M$, whence $\dim(N) - \dim(N/\mathfrak{p}N) = r - 1$;
one may consequently apply to $N$ the induction hypothesis, and if $(x_{i})_{2 \leq i \leq r}$ is an $N$-regular
sequence formed of elements of $\mathfrak{p}$, it is clear that $(x_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ is an $M$-regular sequence
formed of elements of $\mathfrak{p}$. If one sets $P = M/(x_{1} M + \cdots + x_{r} M)$, one has $P/\mathfrak{p}P =
M/\mathfrak{p}M$ since the $x_{i}$ are in $\mathfrak{p}$, and $\dim(P) = \dim(P/\mathfrak{p}P)$ by `(16.5.6)`; but since
$P$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module, one has also $\dim(P) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}')$ for every $\mathfrak{p}' \in
\operatorname{Ass}(P)$ `(16.5.4)`. Since $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Supp}(P)$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$, $\mathfrak{p}$
contains one of the ideals $\mathfrak{p}' \in \operatorname{Ass}(P)$
`(Bourbaki, Alg. comm., chap. IV, §1, no 4, th. 2)`, and since
$\dim(P) = \dim(P/\mathfrak{p}P) \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) \leq \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}') = \dim(P)$, one necessarily has
$\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}'$ `(16.1.2.2)`, which completes the proof.

**Corollary (16.5.10).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.10 -->

*Under the same hypotheses as in `(16.5.9)`:*

*(i) $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module.*

*(ii) One has*

$$ \dim(M) = \dim_{A}(M/\mathfrak{p}M) + \dim_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}). \tag{16.5.10.1} $$

With the notations of `(16.5.9)`, let $x'_{i}$ be the canonical images of the $x_{i}$ in $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ ($1 \leq i
\leq r$); since the $x'_{i}$ belong to the maximal ideal of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ and form an $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$-regular
sequence by flatness `(15.1.14)`, one has

$$ \operatorname{prof}_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) \geq r = \dim(M) - \dim(M/\mathfrak{p}M) \geq \dim_{A_{\mathfrak{p}}}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) $$

(by virtue of `(16.1.8.1)`). But taking `(16.4.5.1)` into account, the three terms of this inequality are necessarily
equal, whence the corollary.

<!-- original page 135 -->

**Corollary (16.5.11).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.11 -->

*Let $A$ be a Noetherian local ring; suppose that there exists an $A$-module of finite type $M$ of support
$\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, which is a Cohen-Macaulay module. Then, for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, one has*

$$ \dim(A) = \dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) + \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}). \tag{16.5.11.1} $$

Indeed, $\operatorname{Supp}(M/\mathfrak{p}M) = \operatorname{Spec}(A/\mathfrak{p})$ $(0_{I}, 1.7.5)$ and
$\operatorname{Supp}(M_{\mathfrak{p}}) = \operatorname{Spec}(A_{\mathfrak{p}})$; the relation `(16.5.11.1)` is therefore
a particular case of `(16.5.10.1)`.

**Corollary (16.5.12).**

<!-- label: 0_IV.16.5.12 -->

*Every quotient ring of a Noetherian local ring $A$ satisfying the conditions of `(16.5.11)` (in particular every
quotient ring of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring) is catenary.*

It evidently suffices to prove that $A$ itself is catenary, in other words that, for two prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}
\subset \mathfrak{q}$ of $A$, one has `(16.1.4.2)`

$$ \dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}}) = \dim(A_{\mathfrak{p}}) + \dim(A_{\mathfrak{q}} / \mathfrak{p} A_{\mathfrak{q}}). $$

Now, by virtue of `(16.5.10, (i))` $A_{\mathfrak{q}}$ satisfies the same hypotheses as $A$, and the preceding relation
is therefore nothing other than `(16.5.11.1)` applied to $A_{\mathfrak{q}}$ and to the prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}
A_{\mathfrak{q}}$ of $A_{\mathfrak{q}}$.

**(16.5.13)** Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $M$ an $A$-module of finite type. We say that $M$ is a *Cohen-Macaulay
$A$-module* if, for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay
$A_{\mathfrak{p}}$-module; by virtue of `(16.5.10)` this definition coincides with `(16.5.1)` when $A$ is local. We say
that $A$ is a *Cohen-Macaulay ring* if all the $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ are. It is clear that if $M$ (resp. $A$) is a
Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module (resp. a Cohen-Macaulay ring), $S^{-1}M$ is a Cohen-Macaulay $S^{-1}A$-module (resp. $S^{-1}A$
is a Cohen-Macaulay ring) for every multiplicative subset $S$ of $A$.
