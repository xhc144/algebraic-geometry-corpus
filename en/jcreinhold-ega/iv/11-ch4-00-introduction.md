> _Translator's note._ The sommaire above reproduces the 1964 announcement printed in Part 1. As the footnote warned,
> the program was revised during the later parts. **§11 was never published** — Part 3 (1966) prints §§8, 9, 10, 12, 13,
> 14, 15, skipping §11. **§§20 and 21 were redrawn**: in Part 4 (1967) §20 became *Meromorphic functions; pseudo-
> morphisms* and §21 became *Divisors*, replacing the announced "hyperplane sections" and "infinitesimal extensions"
> respectively. The translation files use the *published* §20 and §21 titles, and there is no §11 file.

The subjects treated in this chapter call for the following remarks.

**a)** Their common character is to bear on *local properties* of preschemes or of morphisms, i.e. properties considered
at a point, or at the points of a fibre, or in a neighbourhood (unspecified) of a point or of a fibre. These properties
are generally *topological*, *differential*, or *dimensional* in nature (i.e. they bring into play the notions of
dimension and depth), and they are tied to the properties of the local rings at the points in question. A typical
problem is to relate, for a given morphism $f : X \to Y$ and a point $x \in X$, the properties of $X$ at $x$ to those of
$Y$ at $y = f(x)$ and of the fibre $X_{y} = f^{-1}(y)$ at $x$. Another is to determine the topological nature (for
example, constructibility, or being open or closed) of the set of points $x \in X$ at which $X$ has a given property, or
for which the fibre $X_{y}$ through $x$ has a given property at $x$. Similarly, one is interested in the topological
nature of the set of points $y \in Y$ such that $X$ has a given property at every point of the fibre $X_{y}$, or such
that this fibre has a given property.

**b)** The notions of greatest importance for the chapters that follow are those of *flat morphism of finite
presentation* and of *smooth morphism* and *étale morphism* (which are special cases of the former). Their detailed
study (together with that of related questions) really begins at §11.

**c)** §§1 through 10 may be regarded as preliminary in nature; they develop three types of technique, used not only in
the other sections of the chapter but, naturally, in the chapters that follow as well.

**$c_{1}$)** In §§1 through 4 we consider various aspects of the notion of *base change*, especially in relation with
finiteness or flatness conditions; we initiate, at its most elementary level, the technique of *descent* (the
"effectiveness" questions tied to that technique will be studied in Chapter V).

**$c_{2}$)** §§5 through 7 are centred on what we may call *Noetherian techniques*: the preschemes considered are always
supposed locally Noetherian, while no finiteness conditions are imposed on the morphisms; this is essentially because
the notions of dimension and depth are not really workable except for Noetherian local rings. Let us recall that §7
constitutes a "fine" theory of Noetherian local rings, used relatively little in the rest of the chapter.

**$c_{3}$)** §§8 through 10 provide, among other things, the means to *eliminate the Noetherian hypotheses* on the
preschemes under study, replacing them by suitable finiteness hypotheses ("finite presentation") on the morphisms
considered: the advantage of this substitution is that the latter hypotheses are stable under base change, which is not
the case for Noetherian hypotheses on preschemes.

The technique permitting this passage rests, on the one hand, on the use of the notion of *projective limit of
preschemes*, by means of which one may reduce a question to the same question under Noetherian hypotheses; on the other
hand, on the systematic use of constructible sets, which have the double advantage of being preserved under inverse
image (by an arbitrary morphism) and under direct image (by a morphism of finite presentation), and of having manageable
topological properties in locally Noetherian preschemes. The same techniques often allow further reduction to more
particular Noetherian rings, for example finitely generated $k$-algebras ($k$ a field), and this is where the properties
of "excellent" rings (studied in §7) play a decisive role. Independently of the question of eliminating Noetherian
hypotheses, the techniques of §§8 through 10, of very elementary nature, are in constant use in almost all applications.
